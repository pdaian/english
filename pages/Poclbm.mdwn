Poclbm (PyOpenCL bitcoin miner) is a python GPU bitcoin miner that uses the [[OpenCL|OpenCL_miner]] framework to quickly perform the hashing computations.  Works with AMD - 4xxx and up, Nvidia - 8xxx and up, video cards.

##Flags to Use

###Flags List


|Command line flags   |Flags descriptions
|---|---
|-version |Show program's version number and exit
|-h, --help |Show help message and exit
|-u USER, --user=USER |Set user name
|--pass=PASSWORD |Set password
|-o HOST, --host=HOST |Set RPC host (without 'http://')
|-p PORT, --port=PORT |Set RPC port
|-r RATE, --rate=RATE |Set hash rate display interval in seconds, default=1
|-f FRAMES, --frames=FRAMES |Will try to bring single kernel execution to 1/frames seconds, default=30. Increase this for less desktop lag
|-d DEVICE, --device=DEVICE |Set used device by id, by default asks for device
|-a ASKRATE, --askrate=ASKRATE |Set how many seconds between getwork requests, default 5, max 10
|-w WORKSIZE, --worksize=WORKSIZE |Set work group size, default is maximum returned by opencl
|-v, --vectors |Enable vectors, which is faster on some cards.
|--verbose |Enable verbose output, suitable for redirection to log file
|--platform=PLATFORM |Set used platform by id
|-s SLEEPTIME |Sleep for the specified number of seconds between iterations (default 0). Increase this to reduce hashing performance if your temperatures are too high.


###Usage Tips

ATI/AMD Radeon HD 5xxx cards (for example, HD 5770): use '-v -w128'

('-v -f10 -w128' works even better for HD5770.)

If you find the desktop laggy while mining, use '-f60'. This may decrease performance slightly.

Please update this section if you find better settings, or good settings for a card not listed here.

###OpenSUSE

This works on 11.4, 12.1 and should work on other versions - just replace the "12.1" in the repo URLs with your version number. This also assumes that you are already familiar with running getting the BitCoin client running (to run the GUI version on OpenSUSE you will need libpng12-0 installed).

Add the Python devel repo:

<code># zypper ar -r http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/openSUSE_12.1/devel:languages:python.repo</code>

and this user repo, which provides PyOpenCL (take a moment to appreciate this because if "scorot" didn't package it this would be a lot harder):

<code># zypper ar -r http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/scorot/openSUSE_12.1/home:scorot.repo</code>

Refresh your repos:

<code># zypper ref</code>

You will asked to accept the repo keys, respond with 'a' each time.

Install PyOpenCL:

<code># zypper in python-pyopencl</code>

Get the latest version of poclbm with git (`zypper in git-core` if you don't have git installed):

<code>$ git clone git://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm.git</code>

This will create a poclbm folder in your current directory. Change to it:

<code>$ cd poclbm</code>

And run it:

<code>$ python poclbm.py --device=0 http://user:pass@api.example.org:8332 [add whatever other flags you use]</code>
