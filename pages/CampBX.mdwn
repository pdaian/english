A bitcoin [[currency_exchange]]/trading platform site headquartered in USA - Atlanta, GA.

Camp BX is a platform where you can buy and sell Bitcoins for US Dollars in real-time using advanced order-matching algorithms. Any buy or sell order that you place is matched against a database of other orders. If a perfect match is found, a Bitcoin-to-USD trade is executed instantly. If there are no matching orders at the price you specified, then your order can remain open for up to 31 days. To maintain fairness in trading, Camp BX have taken a purely-platform approach and they are never a counter-party to any trade.

This platform was designed from the ground up with stability and security as top priorities, and became the first Bitcoin website to obtain Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification and the McAfee Secure seal of confidence on June 28th, 2011.

Camp BX is also the first Bitcoin platform to bring advanced features like Margin Trading and Short-selling, and have several more innovative features in pipeline.

There are no fees required to open a Camp BX account.

##Trading

Camp BX is the only Bitcoin exchanges to offer both market orders as well as limit orders.  Market orders get filled regardless of the price. 
Additional Advanced Trading options include Fill-or-Kill and All-or-Nothing fills.  Fill-or-Kill means that if the order cannot immediately be matched, it will be cancelled automatically.  All-or-Nothing means that the order will match only when the entire quantity in the order can be traded.  One option is to set a custom expiry date for each order, which allows setting up advanced trading strategies.
The trading algorithms implement trading functionality described in the following SEC Investor Bulletin as closely as possible:

Camp BX also provides Quick Trades for casual Bitcoin users, where you enter the quantity and the desired price for buying or selling Bitcoins, and execute the trade. All prices entered are "Limit" prices, where the platform will find a matching trade at given price or better.

Additionally, though currently disabled, the exchange's trading site refers to margin trading (buying on margin and shorting) -- something that no other exchange has offered yet.

###Fees

Trades on the exchange incur a commission (fee) of 0.55%.  (Volume discounts available)

##History

First mention on the site was on July 5th, 2011 (14.1).
