**witcoin** was a social discussion, collaboration and question/answer site allowing users to submit content and feedback with the potential to profit for their contributions. It is currently defunct, and may be open-sourced in the future.

Viewing content on the site is free, however each reply, post, and vote requires a small payment of real money.  This ensures quality, and, since these payments are shared with the users, it also allows the contributor to earn money from participating.

The site was announced December 29, 2010 while in a development / beta phase (1.1). The service is now defunct, though there was interest in late 2011 from a partner to revive it.
