**witcoin** is a social discussion, collaboration and question/answer site allowing users to submit content and feedback with the potential to profit for their contributions.

Each reply, post, and vote requires a small payment of real money.  This ensures quality, and, since these payments are shared with the users, it also allows the contributor to earn money from participating.

The site was announced December 29, 2010 while in a development / beta phase (1.1).
