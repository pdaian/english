An e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made from through the Internet.

TransferWise can send GBP funds from U.K. bank account to a EUR E.U. bank account and will perform the currency conversion at mid-market rates. 

The service is available for sending from an individual account or from a business account.

This ability to send directly to the recipient's bank will likely make TransferWise a preferred method that will allow those in the U.K. to send funds when purchasing bitcoins through a person-to-person marketplace, such as the [[Bitcoin-otc]] marketplace.

The service was launched in early 2011.

##Fees

There is a 1 GBP fee per transfer.
