The [Bitcoin roulette](http://www.bestbitcoincasino.com/games/roulette/) that is mostly offered in gambling and roulette sites is based on the European roulette. In this way, you can ensure that you will have more chances of scoring big payouts as there is only one zero on the wheel. 

When you bet on roulette with bitcoins, you will notice that you wager on inside and outside bets, just like in roulette games offered by regular online casinos. However, thanks to the use of bitcoins, the process of betting has become a lot easier.

Some roulette sites allow players to simply send their wager directly from their BTC wallet to the dynamically registered address of their bets. This process doesn’t require a registered account. On the other hand, some gambling sites require players to create an account and deposit bitcoins so that they can place their bets.
