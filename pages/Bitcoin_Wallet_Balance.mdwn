**Bitcoin Wallet Balance** is an Android App to allow you to view the balance in your wallet on your Android device.  It works by reading your public key hashes (addresses) and obtaining your transactions from blockexplorer.com.  Keys are exported once, saved in cloud storage, and allow the user to view their balance in real time on their device.  The code is open sourced so it can be freely inspected (since it has to touch the wallet.dat)

This app was announced on June 24, 2011 (1.1).
