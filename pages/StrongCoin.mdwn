This is a browser-wallet where the key-information is stored in the browser and can be accessed via JavaScript.

StrongCoin accounts are protected by a passphrase that is known only to the user and only an encrypted key for that password is stored with StrongCoin (1.1).   As such, if the passphrase is forgotten or lost, not even StrongCoin can help to recover the funds.  The service does provide the ability to print paper backups of the keys which can be re-imported and when doing so no passphrase is required.

##Interesting Features

* Import of private-keys in [[Mini_private_key_format]]
* Printable "paper" backup of key-pairs

##Fees

* StrongCoin adds 0.01 BTC per spend transaction.
