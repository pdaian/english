What is licensing/copyright information on that code? Public domain?

"Because transactions aren't hashed directly, hashing a block with 1 transaction takes exactly the same amount of effort as hashing a block with 10,000 transactions."

Doesn't it take more effort to calculate the Merkle root for 10,000 transactions than it does than for 1 transaction? Of course, you only have to do this once per block, but it's misleading. It seems you're using "hashing a block" to specifically mean the (iterative) hash calculation, not the process of block generation. I recommend rewording to :

"These are hashed only indirectly through the Merkle root. Because transactions aren't hashed directly, hashing a block with 1 transaction takes exactly the same amount of effort as hashing a block with 10,000 transactions, once the Merkle root of those transactions is calculated."

I added PHP code this code will help beginners with what is going on. The code is simple and well documented anyone regardless of PHP knowledge should be able to read this and know how to hash Bitcoins. [RomanKnight](User:RomanKnight) 10:23, 11 January 2014 (EST)
