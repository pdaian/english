[BitsOfProof](https://bitsofproof.com/)'s (BOP's) "supernode" is a Java implementation written by <tt></tt>[[)]].  The "Enterprise" version is closed-source, but [may be open-sourced later](https://github.com/bitsofproof/supernode/commit/95629eb67db443b01b81b6ca9a3c62c230ddee7e).  The API and (in older commits) the deprecated "Community Edition" code is available [on github](https://github.com/bitsofproof/supernode).

Tamas describes supernode as:

* enterprise ready
* a modern, modular implementation of Bitcoin
* having advanced features:
	* Hierarchical and Deterministic Wallet (BIP32)
	* Password Encrypted Private Keys (BIP38)
	* easily memorized pass phrases (BIP39)
