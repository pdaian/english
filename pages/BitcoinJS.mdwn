A reimplementation of Bitcoin using Node.js and web technologies.

It currently implements the basics of the Bitcoin protocol, enough to send and receive transactions via the [[Webcoin]] frontend. All official BitcoinJS components are released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Components

BitcoinJS consists of several loosely coupled component that can be used in different combinations to solve different problems.

### node-bitcoin-p2p

The main component implementing the Bitcoin P2P [[protocol|Protocol]] and parts of the [[JSON-RPC API|API_reference_(JSON-RPC)]]. You can think of it as the counterpart to the [[original client's|Original_Bitcoin_client]] CLI daemon, bitcoind.

As the name implies, node-bitcoin-p2p is built using the [Node.js framework](http://nodejs.org). It also uses [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for storage and indexing of the block chain data.

### node-bitcoin-exit

Builds on top of node-bitcoin-p2p to provide access to balances and transaction information on a per-account basis. It also allows the upload of new transactions to the network. These two functions are enough to allow a client to access the network only through this server.

### Other

Various other software builds on top of the basic BitcoinJS infrastructure. Notable examples include [[Webcoin]] and [[BitcoinJS Explorer|BitcoinJS/Explorer]].
