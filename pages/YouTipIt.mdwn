**YouTipIt** is an online community service that enables you to directly reward people for content they have created.

The concept is essentially the same as that of the busker or street musician: they put their work in a public forum and the public then decides to reward them if they feel it is deserving.

Those who wish to tip may add funds by either sending Bitcoins to their [[eWallet]] with the site or by adding funds with [[PayPal]].  Funds added through PayPal may be spent as tips immediately however those tips must stay within the YouTipIt system for 45 days (1.1)
