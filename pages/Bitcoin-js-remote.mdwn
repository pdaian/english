##Example of an Apache HTTPD Configuration for Bitcoin JS Remote
[am assuming a little knowledge about Apache httpd. You had better read on Apache httpd directives: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html. Of course, this is only an example of many other configurations](I)

Assuming your bitcoin.conf file includes:
	rpcuser=myuser
	rpcpassword=mypass

First, generate a suitable file for Basic Authentification. See man htpasswd or execute
	htpasswd -b -c my_prefer_filename myuser mypass

Set following Apache directives in the proper context, i.e. server or virtual host configuration:
	<Proxy http://127.0.0.1:8332>
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "Bitcoin Access"
	AuthUserFile my_prefer_filename
	Require user myuser
	Order deny,allow
	Allow from all
	</Proxy>

Assuming you want to access Bitcoin JS Remote with http://mydomain/jbc
	Alias /jbc pathabs_to_bitcoin-js-remote
	ProxyPass /lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/
	# ProxyPassReverse is not required because bitcoind talks pure
	# JSON, i.e no HTTP Headers with URIs are generated by bitcoind
	# ProxyPassReverse /lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/

Above ProxyPass directive is asuming you are set the RPC.url field to "/lbc/" into "settings.json" file, located in the bitcoin-js-remote directory. See the settings.json_sample file for proper syntax.

A variety of configurations are feasible:

	# If RPC.url is an absolute path (i.e. RPC.url : /lbc/),
	# bitcoind at 127.0.0.1 shall be accessed by http://mydomain/jbc/
	ProxyPass /lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/
	#
	# If RPC.url is a relative path (i.e. RPC.url : lbc/),
	# bitcoind at 127.0.0.1 shall be accessed by http://mydomain/jbc/lbc/
	ProxyPass lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/
	# 
	# Apache can also proxy your access to any other IP by
	# accessing to http://mydomain/jbc
	ProxyPass /lbc/ http://www.worldbank.org:8332/

Please, note you are *not* required to set into the settings.json file the pair rcpuser/rcppassword. The required header with Basic Authentication is automatically generated by Apache when proxing, thanks for the above Auth directives.

Set RPC.user=rcpuser and RPC.password=rcppassword in the settings.json file if you are not able to configure your Apache webser; for instance, people using hosting instead of virtual or dedicated server. But, please, **keep in mind** settings.json file can be read by everybody: http://mydomain/jbc/settings.json

That's all. Restart your Apache web server.

### Other interesting Apache directives:

To redirect all HTTP to HTTPS (of course, you need a well-configured ssl site).
!!! SSL access **is extremely recommended** to protect your Bitcoin data.
	RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
	RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}

To avoid your log file from flooding
	SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/jbc/" dontlog
	SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/lbc/" dontlog
	CustomLog myfile.log combined env=!dontlog

Finally, if you go in trouble, check proper access to bitcoin daemon with curl:
	curl --trace-time --trace-ascii - \
	--data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' \
	--header 'content-type: text/plain;'\
	http://myuser:mypass@127.0.0.1:8332/
