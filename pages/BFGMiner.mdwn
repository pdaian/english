A modular ASIC, FPGA, GPU and CPU miner written in C, cross platform for Linux, Mac, and Windows including support for OpenWrt-capable routers.

##Features

* A variety of device drivers for Bitcoin (SHA256d):
	* [Butterfly Labs's BitForce SC (ASIC) product line](http://www.butterflylabs.com/bitforce-sc-release-notes/)
	* [Avalon ASIC mining rig](http://launch.avalon-asics.com/)
	* [Butterfly Labs's FPGA BitForce Singles and MiniRigs](http://www.butterflylabs.com/product-details/)
	* [Enterpoint's Cairnsmore1 FPGA mining board](http://www.enterpoint.co.uk/cairnsmore/cairnsmore1.html)
	* [FPGA Mining X6500](http://fpgamining.com/products/x6500-rev3)
	* Qi Hardware's [Icarus](http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Icarus) and [Lancelot](http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Lancelot) FPGA mining boards
	* [BTCFPGA's ModMiner Quad FPGA-based mining device](http://www.btcfpga.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=50)
	* [Ztex's FPGA boards](http://www.ztex.de/)
	* OpenCL GPUs, such as [AMD Radeons](http://www.amd.com/us/products/Pages/graphics.aspx)
		* Kernels (including BFI_INT patching): Diablo, DiaKGCN, Phatk and poclbm
		* VECTOR support
		* Dynamic intensity that keeps desktop interactive under load and maximises throughput when desktop idle
		* Integrated overclocking and fan control (including automatic adjustment, if configured)
		* ADL device reordering by PCI bus ID
		* GCN (79x0) support
	* CPU (not enabled by default nor included in Windows build)
	* Coming soon:
		* [ASICMINER ASICs](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=99497)
		* *any other device provided for development*
* Support for new [[getblocktemplate decentralized mining protocol|Getblocktemplate]]
* Scrypt mining support for both CPU and OpenCL (GPU)
* Very low overhead free C code for Linux and Windows with very low CPU usage
* Long poll support - will use longpoll from any pool if primary pool does not support it
* epoll support for interrupting FPGA waiting when new work is available without timeout-looping
* Self detection of new blocks with a mini-database for slow/failing longpoll scenarios, maximum work efficiency and minimum rejects
* Heavily threaded code hands out work retrieval and work submission to separate threads to not hinder devices working
* Caching of submissions during transient network outages
* Preemptive fetching of work prior to completion of current work
* Local generation of more valid work (rollntime) whenever possible, as supported on a per-work item basis
* Prevention of stale work submission on new block (submitold also supported)
* Automatically detects failing pools and disables them
* Multi-device support (all or discrete selection)
* Summarised and discrete device data statistics of requests, accepts, rejects, hw errors, efficiency and utility
* Watchdog thread to restart idle threads but not crash machine if they don't respond
* Summary displayed when quitting
* Supports multiple pools with multiple intelligent failover mechanisms
* On the fly menu based management of most settings
* Trickling of extra work to backup pools if primary pool is responding but slow
* On the fly enabling/disable/restarting of devices
* Device temperature monitoring (for devices that support it)
* Reuses persistent connections when possible
* RPC +/- JSON interface for remote control
* Ability to cope with slow routers
* X-Reject-Reason support
* Lots of other stuff I can't remember. See options.
