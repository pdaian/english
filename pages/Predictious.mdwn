[Predictious](https://www.predictious.com) is the Premier Bitcoin Prediction market. You can trade predictions on Sport, Movies, TV, Politics, Bitcoin Economy, etc. and if you are right, win Bitcoins.

Predictious is similar to the now shutdown website [InTrade](http://www.intrade.com/v4/home/), it's a [futures exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange) running on Bitcoins. 

##Prediction Market

When someone [places an order](https://predictious.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/1194963-how-do-i-buy-or-sell-shares-) on Predictious for X to happen, and somebody else places an order for the opposite outcome Y to happen (X and Y are mutually exclusive), a share of each is created. For example, if a user places an order for X at 4 and another user places an order for Y at 6, a share of X and a share of Y will be created. In the end, either X or Y will resolve at m฿10.

The other Bitcoin betting websites (and most sport betting websites) use a pari-mutuel betting system, all bets are placed in a pool, and when the outcome of the event is determined, the winners share the funds in that pool. There are several disadvantages for the player with pari-mutuel betting: Players have to wait until the event is finished to unlock their profits. Also, players don't know what odds they will get when they place their bet, as the odds may change over time as more people vote more for one outcome or the other.

On the other end, with Predictious, the user places an order for a prediction, at a number of shares and price of his choice. Each share for a prediction will earn exactly 10 millibitcoins (1 millibitcoin = 0.001 bitcoin) if the prediction is correct, so odds are guaranteed. The predictious system then matches complementary orders together.
