[BTClevels](http://btclevels.com/) is a website where you can make money completely hassle-free by forecasting short-term [[Bitcoin]] exchange rate fluctuations. We tried to create a user-friendly, simple, and easy-to-understand interface and a smart trading mode that lets you hedge your positions. This way, irrespective of the interval results, the smarter you act, the bigger your income is.

You can choose yourself what kind of bets — with registration or without — you make. In point of fact, registered bidders do not have improved trading opportunities and can merely enjoy facilitated functionality and better user experience when working with BTCLevels.
