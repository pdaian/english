They still own me my BTC and trieing now to declare me as an hacker who running DOS attacks against them. They treing to turn the whole issue, not answering to the core questions:

- Why your Phonenummber is not valid?
- Why did you not transfered my BTC jet?
- why are 80 bets in about 10 min a DOS, where it saiyed that I am not allowed to?
- When will you transfer that btc to my account finally, so that I can stop that war?


I tried to contact via Phone but the given Number seams to be wrong. Now I just reseived a Mail from them after constantly warn you all about them here. If there it does not go in the diretion of getting finally my BTCs I will pot it here.


* Update 24.09.2013
In addition they finally deleted my account including over 8.5BTC still not responding at all. And changed this Site back to the old one in order to look serios. I am already in touch with my lawyer and few other people who were scammed by btclevels, preparing for the court. Any more people who are interesed in joining me to fight against them are welcome: ash AT n3xus DOT eu
Lets make BTC serios!!!



I write you as I was scamed by btclevels.com. I got still a bit above 8BTC in my account at them, but I am unable to get the bitcoins out there anymore. In the beginning all went fine when I started without an account. I send few bitcoins there, I got some back.

However as I noticed that sometimes they are loggin the oppusite price ( so if I bet the price goes up, beeing one the lower line of the marked, which did not changed anyway as there was not markedactivity during my bet, there system give me the higher value). If I bet the other way around the system give me (rendomly,- not allways) the higher value, even there is no marked activity.)

So then I had an idea to set a "blocker" with some of my bitcoins, to keep the marked very tight, so that there system cannot cheat me. ... I made my bets, waited and finally replaced my blocker to win actually my bet with btclevels.com. This system worked pritty well. Too well I think in btclevels eys.
The End of the storry is that I created myself an account on there page to get things faster and transfered about 3BTC, and tested my system further on. This was working very well. Then I transferted me my 3 bitcoins back which was working at this time and did some more btc. finally as I wrote above I still got about 8 BTC in my account.

Now when I try to transfer the btc to any adress I get the systemmessage "incorrect amount"  displayed. I already tried tro write them and got firstly even an answer:
"Hello dear user,
I've forwarded your claim to our financial dpt, 
please be standby, we'll write you some later.
Kind regards,
"

... after 2 Mails more from me as they did answered anymore I got this on 27. Aug:
"Dear MyName,
please be patient,
we will check everything and if there no problems with rules of playing - you will get your money.
I don't know about the reason of you cannot withdraw money, because other members of btclevels use it everyday. Our teamlead says that it may be fraud or something like that.
We will check today or in bad case tomorrow all logs of your play. I hope that everything is ok and I will send money to your btc address manually.
Thank you for understanding,
Adrian."

If I read correct they wanted to send me the money manually in a day or so,- right?

However since then they do not answer anymore at all to my Mails. I told them that if they do not get my btc to my adress I will complain this to the BTC community as I am doing here right now to warn you all about those scammers.

BTW: the provided Phonenumer they give is also wrong

YES they pay,- but just a very littel above the btc you are putting in. so If you winning to much they will not pay you anymore. SCAMMERS!!!!!

##Reply to Criticism

Mr Timo, we know you for a long time. You tried to fraud and blackmail our service multiple times. Now you are using social engineering. You are the only "scammed" BTClevles user, you can not find any other fraud reports. As you can see on bitcointalk  no one except you told about fraud in our topics. Our users are satisfied with our service. Even if there was some issues or inconvenience, they were solved immediately. You on the other hand tried to conduct unfair game from the beginning.


Example:

On 23 of July you wrote a mail where you've asked us to return your "stolen" bitcoins. Otherwise you threatened to publicly announce BTClevels as a scam. You made a bet but the exchange rate has not changed. According to our rules, http://btclevels.com/fairplay, in this case, you are losing money.

Eventually, you admitted that you was wrong.

my bad,
the price was exactly the same. So I assumed that in this case I would =
get my BTC back like in any options. ;(

so please ignore my last mails

You wrote:
You just stole me over night 3.3 BTC, which I bet that the price will be higher then 91.60001 at 5 UTC, which it was as there was and still is a blocker in at this level. So what happened with my btc  do I need to report you as a scammer?.

Later you've made multiple attempts to cheat the system. For example, on 25 of August our suspicious activity monitoring responded that you've made more than 80 bets in 10 minutes using a third-party application. These bets, as well as other, are made in some unclear way. They were made backdated, while bets on current expiration was not accepted.

Option's security system automatically blocked your account. After your emails where you blackmailed and threatened to put the story in public, we have studied your case, and we agreed with the automated system and finally blocked your account.

This was done not to fraud or gain, but only for our own safety. Our team made a great effort to develop a binary option to the Bitcoin community, and not for the hackers enrichment.

Again, no one except you, has complaints about the quality of our service. Yes, we had problems with the server, hoster and Gox API, but in this cases we compensated funds to our users.

Your bitcoins is in our wallet and we will send it to any bitcoin accepting charity organization of your choice. For example, https://bitcoinfoundation.org/ or http://bitcoin100.org/

We respect and appreciate the Bitcoin community, they helped us develop our product and we will not allow to put us in a bad light.

Therefore, we ask you to choose a charity organization and to delete all the messages that BTClevles is a scam.
