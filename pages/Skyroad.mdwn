To get the Money into Bitcoins, only three Steps (4.1) need to be taken:<br />
1. Type in your Bitcoin Adress using */btc <address>* (Example: /btc 1MaXZE92yjuy4NYjTspmdWHMRT3jQUcTf4)<br />
2. Check the Adress using */payout* (Check, if the Address is 100% correct, step forward.)<br />
3. Use */payoutok <amount>* to send the Money to the Address, use the Server Economy as amount. (Example: /payoutok 15000)<br /><br />

Skyroad is trying to send the Bitcoins very fast, but it can take in some cases up to 24 hours for an approval.
