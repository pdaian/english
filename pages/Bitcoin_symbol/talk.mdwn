## ϭ has relation to bitcoin

<font style="font-size:1.5em;">ϭ</font> actually does have a visible relation to bitcoin, seeing as it is the lower-case russian B. :)

## Pros and cons as different collums?

I think it would be better if the pros and cons were in sepparate colums to make it easier to evaluate the proposals; what do you say? --[TiagoTiago](User:TiagoTiago) 15:23, 26 April 2011 (GMT)

## Removal of section called Existing Unicode symbol

Unless good reason are given, I would like to delete the section called "Existing Unicode symbol" [Pander](User:Pander) 12:04, 21 July 2011 (GMT)

* I object because B⃦ is already more or less universally accepted (Bitcoin.org, Bitbills.com, Bitcoin Charts/Watch/OTC, etc) as the standard BTC symbol. Unicode isn't going to accept any new symbol for a niche currency, so anything new would be relegated to the PUA anyway. Let's stick to what works. In fact, even if Bitcoin were to get enough non-niche use, both "submissions" currently listed are basically just font variants of B⃦. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 17:01, 21 July 2011 (GMT)
* I think it would be a good idea to get our own symbol, but as B⃦ is already fairly universally accepted, it isn't a huge priority.  I think the Existing Unicode symbol section should stay.  I don't think though we should discard the two submissions based on them being stylized B⃦'s.  I think they are sufficiently different from B⃦ for our purposes.
