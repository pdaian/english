**Halving day 2012** (November 28, 2012) was the day of the first [[subsidy halving|controlled_supply]], which occurred when **block 210000** was solved. Until [[block 420000|halving_day_2016]], the block reward would be **25 BTC** instead of the original 50 BTC.

At the moment before the halving, there were 10,500,000 BTC in existence, 50% of the target cap.
