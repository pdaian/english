Btctip is a service that allows Twitter users to send bitcoins to each other using a tweet. Visitors can log in to the website with only their Twitter account.  The site lets users access their account history, to withdraw and to deposit bitcoins.

**Green address deposits**

Users can deposit bitcoins into their Btctip account from a MtGox [[green_address]] to have their deposit registered with zero-confirmations in about 30 seconds. Non-green-address deposits take three confirmations, or about 30 minutes, to be registered by the site.

**Sending bitcoins**

The format for sending bitcoins is:

	#btctip [[recipient]] [[amount]] [[unit]]

For example:

	#btctip @BobOnTwitter 10 bitcents

The permitted units are bitcoins, bitcents, and millibits.

The variations of each that are recognized by btctip.com are:

bitcoin: bitcoin, bitcoins and btc

bitcent: bitcent, bitcents, and cbtc

millibit: millibit, millibits, and mbtc

Note that , (comma) is treated the same as . (decimal mark), so for example, 10,2 bitcents will be interpreted as 10.2 bitcents.

A user's tweet can contain other text as well, as long as some segment of it contains the tipping command. 

For example, this would be valid:

	Great post! #btctip @BobOnTwitter 10 bitcents!

After btctip.com has registered a user's tweet, the Twitter account @btctip will post a tweet verifying the transaction, in the following format:

	@Recipient, you received a [[Amount]] BTC tip from @Sender! Log in with Twitter to btctip.com to claim your bitcoin!
