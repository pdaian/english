* Bitcoin, the first DAC?
* Bitcoin forks
* Ripple Labs is borderline ... they are a registered company and could be ordered to shutdown. The protocol is perhaps a DAC.
* Mastercoin, a DAC replacement for Forex, Shares, and much more.
* ProtoShares, a meta DAC with the purpose of privding infrastructure for other DACs. It is composed of
	* DomainShares, a DAC replacement for Namecoin
	* BitShares, a competitor to Mastercoin (with much more limited feature set IMHO)
	* Keyhotee, a DAC replacement for OpenID
	* Other infrastructure components to follow... ? 
* Mitosys - a DAC replacement for Bit-Message
* Colored Coins are working on defining themselves as a DAC ... I haven't seen a working business model yet.

## Ideas

* A social network - Monetizable Diaspora
