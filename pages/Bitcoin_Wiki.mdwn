This is a community wiki aimed at allowing the Bitcoin community as a whole to document freely what they feel needs documentation or representation.

## Internationalization
This wiki uses a multi-lingual scheme similar to Wikipedia's, which means a translated article get links to its translation in the menu (in the left column from the [[index]]). 

If you feel one language is missing and are ready to start translating a lot of pages, you can request the creation of the language of your choice by contacting me ([MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux)).
