##Games

[[!img "BV_Slots2.png" title="border" size=600x600]]

###BlackJack

Your standard BlackJack game. The player receives two cards, as does the dealer. Once the cards are dealt, the player has the option to "hit", or receive another card. At the end of the round, the players with the closest total card face value to 21 wins. If the player's total card value goes over 21 the player loses.

###Bacon Racing

An amusing recreation of horse racing. Four pigs are brought to the track where they wait for thirty seconds. During these thirty seconds, players are shown information such as the pig's chances of winning and the payout of betting on that pig. After the thirty seconds, the pigs race to the finish line. The pig in first place is the winner and the players who had bet on that pig are rewarded.

###Poker

Try to get a better hand than the other players!

[[!img "BV_Poker.png" title="border" size=600x600]]

###Roulette

There is a board with thirty six numbers, zero through thirty six. Zero is the only green number, and the numbers from one through thirty six alternate between black and red. Players have the option to bet on individual numbers, corners connecting numbers, sides connecting numbers, dozens of numbers (first, second, third dozen), the color of the number, the column, whether the number will be even or odd, or you can bet on the first or second eighteen numbers. Payouts are directly proportionate to the odds of that particular event occurring. Players are allowed to bet on as many blocks as they like and will receive the payment they earn for every block they win.

###MineField

Players place a bet and then are locked in a room with a five by five square of grass. Each block has the potential to be a bomb. If a player mines a bomb, they lose the game. The player is allowed to cash out at any time. If they do this, they will receive their initial bet as well as anything they have won so far. There are two rooms, one has three bombs and the other has five. Both rooms have the same amount of grass. The number of Bitcoins received per non-explosive block mined is proportional to both the number of blocks already mined, the initial bet, and the number of bombs in the room.

When a player types "/referrals" in the game, they will be shown information regarding their referrals. This includes a link to their referral page, the number of referrals they have, and the number of times their referral page has been visited. A referral link is the same as a link to http://www.bitvegas.net, except that once visiting the referral link, the website logs the user's IP address.

Upon joining the server, if the IP the user displays is the same as one that has been displayed on the player's referral page, the player will receive the referral reward.
