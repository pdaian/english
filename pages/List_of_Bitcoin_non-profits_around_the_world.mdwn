This page will list all the known Bitcoin and crypto-currency non-profits around the world. See also on [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=288677.0) and [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TnTCcT7fiNr5nt-oApr_7DwXAypFoJpZ6lk_w_ykwcc/edit). The criterias for being on this list are:

1. A focus on Bitcoin or crypto-currency (merely accepting Bitcoin donations is not enough)
1. Being a non-profit
1. The organization needs to be either a registered non-profit or in the process of active registration.

FYI, members are sorted alphabetically by their last name.
