[[!template id=counterparty-warning]]## Intro[BitBrothers LLC](https://www.bitbrothersllc.com/) has recently teamed up with a high risk credit card payment processor in an attempt to allow users to buy bitcoins with their credit cards. Because the risk is so high, the fees are slightly higher than other exchanges, however with the higher fees comes excellent customer service and order tracking. No account registration, verification, or authentication is required. Please keep in mind though, this service still takes ample steps in order to prevent credit card fraud and money laundering.

### Transaction Times
The transaction times for this website vary heavily depending on what region you are from, however the typical waiting period for the buyer to receive their bitcoins is just around four days. 

### Military Grade Encryption
[BitBrothers LLC](https://www.bitbrothersllc.com/) uses the highest level of encryption that the United States Government uses, 256 AES, for each and every communication between their server and your computer. Bitcoin also uses this standard of encryption for the actual network, which is why it is so resilient to attack. Check us out at http://www.bitbrothersllc.com

### Chargeback Prevention
Alongside using a high risk payment processor, a few other services are used in conjunction that lower the rate of fraudulent transfers that go through from 2.19% to .25%. 

"Typically, if a transaction is attempted with stolen credit card information, we take every step necessary to find out who that individual is." -Cameron Schorg, C.E.O
