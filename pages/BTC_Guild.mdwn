[[!template id=infobox_company name="BTC Guild" image=[[File:BTCGuild.png 256px]] trading_name="BTC Guild" industry="[[Mining pool]]" founder=[[Eleuthria]] foundation="May 9, 2011" hashrate="11.7 PHash/s" website=http://www.btcguild.com]]**BTC Guild** is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]] which offers proportional ([[PPLNS]]) based rewards, where your reward is equal to the block value, multiplied by your valid shares submitted during the round.  The pool does not take a fee from each block solved, and calculates rewards to the full 8 decimal points supported by the Bitcoin protocol.  The pool is run off the donations of users, and is offering premium services at different donation levels to encourage users to donate a small percentage of their rewards.  Donations are taken from the individual user's reward when a block is calculated.

2.5% donators (calculated on a per block basis) are able to claim their rewards without waiting for 120 confirmations of the block.  This also acts as invalid protection, similar to [[DeepBit]], where a user can claim rewards even if the block is later invalidated/orphaned by the network.

The [[coinbase]] signature for this pool is: "Mined by BTC Guild" (1.1).

BTC Guild first opened up on May 9th, 2011. (1.2) It is currently for sale and a possible buyer has been found. There is a 90 day notice period. If the sale does not go through, another 90 day notice period will be announced. 30 days for the pool to stop operation and an additional 60 days for users to withdraw their mining proceeds (1.3).
