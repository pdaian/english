**cgminer for Mac OS X** is the unofficial binary distribution of [[CGMiner]] for Mac OS X computers.  It contains precompiled universal binaries (for Mac OS X 10.5+) and includes the necessary libraries required to make them run, contained in a single package.

A launcher script is included to simplify entering command-line options, which then opens a Terminal window running cgminer.
