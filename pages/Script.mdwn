Bitcoin uses a scripting system for [[transactions]]. [Forth](Wikipedia:FORTH)-like, Script is simple, stack-based, and processed from left to right. It is purposefully not Turing-complete, with no loops.

A script is essentially a list of instructions recorded with each transaction that describe how the next person wanting to spend the Bitcoins being transferred can gain access to them.  The script for a typical Bitcoin transfer to destination Bitcoin address D simply encumbers future spending of the bitcoins with two things: the spender must provide

1. a public key that, when hashed, yields destination address D embedded in the script, and
1. a signature to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the public key just provided.

Scripting provides the flexibility to change the parameters of what's needed to spend transferred Bitcoins.  For example, the scripting system could be used to require two private keys, or a combination of several, or even no keys at all.

A transaction is valid if nothing in the combined script triggers failure and the top stack item is true (non-zero).  The party who originally *sent* the Bitcoins now being spent, dictates the script operations that will occur *last* in order to release them for use in another transaction.  The party wanting to spend them must provide the input(s) to the previously recorded script that results in those operations occurring last leaving behind true (non-zero).

Scripts are big-endian.

The stacks hold byte vectors.  Byte vectors are interpreted as little-endian variable-length integers with the most significant bit determining the sign of the integer.  Thus 0x81 represents -1.  0x80 is another representation of zero (so called negative 0).  Byte vectors are interpreted as Booleans where False is represented by any representation of zero, and True is represented by any representation of non-zero.

## Words
This is a list of all Script words (commands/functions). Some of the more complicated opcodes are disabled out of concern that the client might have a bug in their implementation; if a transaction using such an opcode were to be included in the chain any fix would risk forking the chain. 

True=1 and False=0.

###Pseudo-words
These words are used internally for assisting with transaction matching. They are invalid if used in actual scripts.


|Word|Opcode|Hex|Description
|---|---|---|---
|OP_PUBKEYHASH|253|0xfd|Represents a public key hashed with OP_HASH160.

|OP_INVALIDOPCODE|255|0xff|Matches any opcode that is not yet assigned.


### Reserved words
Any opcode not assigned is also reserved. Using an unassigned opcode makes the transaction invalid.



|Word|Opcode|Hex|When used...
|---|---|---|---
|OP_RESERVED|80|0x50|Transaction is invalid unless occuring in an unexecuted OP_IF branch
|OP_VER|98|0x62|Transaction is invalid unless occuring in an unexecuted OP_IF branch

|OP_NOP1-OP_NOP10|176-185|0xb0-0xb9|The word is ignored.


## Scripts
This is a list of interesting scripts. Keep in mind that all constants actually use the data-pushing commands above.

### Standard Transaction to Bitcoin address

	scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
	scriptSig: <sig> <pubKey>

To demonstrate how scripts look on the wire, here is a raw scriptPubKey:
<pre>  76       A9             14
OP_DUP OP_HASH160    Bytes to push

89 AB CD EF AB BA AB BA AB BA AB BA AB BA AB BA AB BA AB BA   88         AC
                      Data to push                     OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG</pre>

Note: scriptSig is in the input of the spending transaction and scriptPubKey is in the output of the previously unspent i.e. "available" transaction.

Here is how each word is processed:


|Stack |Script |Description 
|---|---|---
|Empty.|<sig><pubKey>OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash>OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG |scriptSig and scriptPubKey are combined.
|<sig><pubKey>|OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash>OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG |Constants are added to the stack.
|<sig><pubKey><pubKey>|OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash>OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG |Top stack item is duplicated.
|<sig><pubKey><pubHashA>|<pubKeyHash>OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|Top stack item is hashed.
|<sig><pubKey><pubHashA><pubKeyHash>|OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|Constant added.
|<sig><pubKey>|OP_CHECKSIG|Equality is checked between the top two stack items.
|true|Empty.|Signature is checked for top two stack items.


### Standard Generation / transaction to IP address

	scriptPubKey: <pubKey> OP_CHECKSIG
	scriptSig: <sig>

Checking process:


|Stack |Script |Description 
|---|---|---
|Empty.|<sig><pubKey>OP_CHECKSIG|scriptSig and scriptPubKey are combined.
|<sig><pubKey>|OP_CHECKSIG|Constants are added to the stack.
|true|Empty.|Signature is checked for top two stack items.


### Transaction with a message

It's possible to add arbitrary data to any transaction by just adding some data along with OP_DROP. Scripts are limited to 10,000 bytes and 201 instructions/values, and each individual instruction/value is limited to 520 bytes.

	scriptPubKey: <message> OP_DROP <pubKey> OP_CHECKSIG
	scriptSig: <sig>



|Stack |Script |Description 
|---|---|---
|Empty.|<sig><message>OP_DROP <pubKey>OP_CHECKSIG|
|<sig>|<message>OP_DROP <pubKey>OP_CHECKSIG|scriptSig added to the stack.
|<sig><message>|OP_DROP <pubKey>OP_CHECKSIG|The message has been put.
|<sig>|<pubKey>OP_CHECKSIG|Top stack item has been removed.
|<sig><pubKey>|OP_CHECKSIG|Checking signature against the public key.
|true|Empty.|Stack holds the value of signature check now.


### Example non standard transaction on Testnet

These 2 links below show a non standard transaction. It just prepends the hex of "bob" and the operation OP_DROP
which just removes it. As you can see they can be spent as normal.

Input non-std transaction:
http://blockexplorer.com/testnet/t/6ttfeb55B1

Spent by:
