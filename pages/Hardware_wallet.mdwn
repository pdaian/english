A **hardware wallet** is a device that stores a part of a user's [[wallet]] securely in mostly-offline hardware. They have major advantages over other wallet types:

* the key is often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext
* immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets
* can be used securely and interactively, as opposed to a [[paper_wallet]] which must be imported to software at some point
* much of the time, the software is open source, allowing a user to validate the entire operation of the device

This page is an attempt to summarize all the known developments of hardware wallets that can use Bitcoin as part of their operation.



## Purchasable hardware wallets

### Pi Wallet - cold storage

[Pi-Wallet Shop](http://www.pi-wallet.com/)

[Further informations about Pi-Wallet](http://www.pi-wallet.com/pages/what-is-pi-wallet)

The Pi-Wallet is comparable to an offline Notebook. 

However it combines all features of the Armory bitcoin client (e.g. offline transaction signing) with the advantages of a tiny computer.

To sign offline-transaction you will need an (unused) USB stick.

## Not purchasable hardware wallets

### BitcoinCard Megion Technologies-Card based wallet

[Bitcoincard Home Page](http://www.bitcoincard.org/)

[Excellent review by evoorhees](http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2012/6/19/our-discovery-in-vienna-the-bitcoin-card.html)

Incorporates a e-paper display, keypad, and radio (custom ISM band protocol.) Unfortunately it is fairly limited in terms of transaction I/O, requiring a radio gateway or another bitcoincard wherever funds need to be transferred.

### Trezor - slush/stick hardware wallet

[Hardware wallet project](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122438.0)

A simple transaction-signing device, requires software on the receiving side to send and receive transactions. Talks over USB, OLED display, confirm/cancel buttons.

### BitSafe - allten/someone42's hardware wallet

[BitSafe Hardware Wallet Development - BOM Ready - 50 kits being prepared](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=127587.0)

Signing transactions only, requires USB host software for transactions & USB power. Has a OLED display and Confirm/Cancel buttons. Evolved out of someone42's prototype below, and has significant contributions from someone42 as well.

### someone42's original prototype

[Hardware Bitcoin wallet - a minimal Bitcoin wallet for embedded devices](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78614.0)

Signing transactions only, requires USB host software for transactions & USB power. All work is rolled into the above BitSafe wallet currently.

[ANN Smartcard wallet project + btchip implementation (no reader required)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=134999.0)

[www.btchip.com](http://www.btchip.com)

USB smartcard dedicated to bitcoins, no keypad or display so trust in the host device is required. An improvement has been implemented that uses a secret value known to the user during the transaction for additional security.

## Smart Card based wallets
This type of device requires complete trust in the host device, as there is no method for user input.
