A **hardware wallet** is a device that stores a part of a user's [[wallet]] securely in mostly-offline hardware. They have major advantages over other wallet types:

* the key is often stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext
* immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets
* can be used securely and interactively, as opposed to a [[paper_wallet]] which must be imported to software at some point
* much of the time, the software is open source, allowing a user to validate the entire operation of the device

This page is an attempt to summarize all the known developments of hardware wallets that can use Bitcoin as part of their operation.

[[!img "piper.jpg" size=300x300 size=120x120 class="left" title="Piper wallet from the front"]]
Piper is the easiest way to store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies securely.

* Easy: Simply press the button to print a new paper wallet. You can choose to have Piper store your keys. Backup is as easy as plugging in a USB drive.
* Secure: Paper wallets are the most secure way to store your Bitcoin.  Piper is the only offline wallet to pass all 26 Dieharder tests to ensure secure private key generation.
* Customizable: Plug in a display, mouse, and keyboard and customize Piper to do whatever you want. It's Linux-based, open source, and powered by the Raspberry Pi. You can even use your own printer!

### [[TREZOR]] The Bitcoin Safe

[[!img "Trezor-tx.jpg" size=300x300 size=120x120 class="left" title="Confirming the transaction with TREZOR"]]

[[TREZOR]] is a secure bitcoin storage and a transaction signing tool. The private keys are generated by the device and never leave it thus they cannot be accessed by a malware.

It uses a deterministic wallet structure which means it can hold an unlimited number of keys (BIP32/BIP44). A recovery seed is generated when the device is initialized. In case TREZOR gets lost or stolen, all its contents can be recovered using this seed (private keys, bitcoin balance and transaction history) into a new device or another BIP39/BIP44 compatible wallet. 

TREZOR also introduced a unique way of PIN entering preventing keyloggers from recording it even when entered on a compromised computer. An encryption passphrase can be set on top of the PIN protection. More passphrases can be used for plausible deniability.

[Further informations about Pi-Wallet](http://www.pi-wallet.com/pages/what-is-pi-wallet)

The Pi-Wallet is comparable to an offline Notebook. 

However it combines all features of the Armory bitcoin client (e.g. offline transaction signing) with the advantages of a tiny computer.

To sign offline-transaction you will need an (unused) USB stick.

### Ledger Wallet - USB Smartcard Hardware Wallet

[[!img "ledger_wallet_dongle.png" size=300x300 size=120x120 class="left" title="Ledger Wallet USB"]]

Ledger Wallet protects your Bitcoin data within a smartcard. Its micro-processor certified against all types of attacks (both physical and logical), and has been used in the banking industry for decades (think credit card chips).

The Ledger Wallet connects to your computer through the USB port and will do all the Bitcoin cryptographic heavy lifting such as signing transactions inside its secure environment. You can therefore use your Bitcoin account with maximum trust, even on an insecure or compromised computer.

It is compatible with Electrum 2.0 for power users, or with the Ledger Wallet Chrome application which provides an easy onboarding as well as a seamless user experience.

### BTChip HW.1 - USB Smartcard Hardware Wallet
[HW.1 Home Page](https://www.hardwarewallet.com)

[[!img "Btchip_dongle.jpg" size=220x220 size=120x120 class="left" title="HW.1 inserted in a laptop"]]

HW.1 is an implementation of a deterministic (BIP 32) Hardware Wallet on a USB smartcard.

It is typically used as a blind secure device for multi signature transactions - holding a set of derived private keys and signing transactions without requiring user confirmation.

Power users can rely on it to confirm all transactions with a second factor scheme turning the dongle into a keyboard typing what the user is supposed to have signed, as a protection against malware.

It is also possible to customize HW.1 for more specfic needs, such as creating a prepaid card without revealing the deterministic seed before it is received by the user, or securing bitcoin transactions on a server.

### BitcoinCard Megion Technologies-Card based wallet
[[!img "Bitcoincard-medley-large.jpg" size=400x400 size=120x120 class="left" title="Bitcoin Card"]]
[Bitcoincard Home Page](http://www.bitcoincard.org/)

[Excellent review by evoorhees](http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2012/6/19/our-discovery-in-vienna-the-bitcoin-card.html)

Incorporates a e-paper display, keypad, and radio (custom ISM band protocol.) Unfortunately it is fairly limited in terms of transaction I/O, requiring a radio gateway or another bitcoincard wherever funds need to be transferred.

## Smart Card based wallets
This type of device requires complete trust in the host device, as there is no method for user input.
