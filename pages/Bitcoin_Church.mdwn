6) Do unto others as you would have them DDoS you.

7) Thou shalt not swear unto another man that thine payment hath not been received until all of the blockchain hath been downloadeth.

8) Salt thine passwords.

9) Hack thine planet.

10) Keep thine woman, Bruces and Atlases in separate camps if they are unclean.

11) Troll harder.
