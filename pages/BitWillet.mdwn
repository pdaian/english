An easy shopping cart interface allowing a site to easily accept Bitcoins as payment. 

The service was launched on June 28, 2011 (1.1), and closed for new signups on June 2, 2012 (1.2).

### How It Works

* A customer clicks a 'Buy with BTC' button / link.
* BitWillet provides a unique Bitcoin address.
* Once payment to that address is confirmed, BitWillet POSTs the purchase information to a specified URL.
* The URL can redirect the customer to the digital goods, record purchase information, etc.

### Integration Details

#### Client-Side

* The BitWillet JavaScript is loaded by adding <code><script src="http://www.bitwillet.com/plugin/bitwillet.js" type="text/javascript"></script></code>.
* A button or link which initiates the BitWillet offer is added:

	<a onClick="bitwillet( 'OFFER_ID' );" href="#"> 
	Purchase "OFFER_TITLE" with Bitcoins!
	</a> 
	<noscript> Please enable Javascript to access "OFFER_TITLE". </noscript> 

#### Seller-Side

* A URL handler is created which will accept BitWillet's purchase confirmation POST.
