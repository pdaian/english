Bitcoin dice allows people to jump in the game with provably fair rolls, determine their own risk, and win tons of BTC in one lucky roll of the dice. This short and inclusive Bitcoin dice review tackles all the significant features this Bitcoin game has to offer. There are games where you can bet on Roll LO only while others on Roll HI only.
