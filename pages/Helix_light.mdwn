The Helix Light system is very simple. Give us the address you want the bitcoins sent to. We give you an address to send them to. You have 4 hours to send 1 transaction between .02 and 6 bitcoins. We will take a 3% fee and send you brand new coins.

Clean coins in <span style="color:red;font-size:1.25em">**30**</span> minutes

After the intial transaction you send to Helix has 3 confirmations, the coins will be cleaned and sent back to you with 1 transaction immediately. The process can take up to 2 hours, but because of reserve clean coins, 95% of all helixes are sent with in 30 minutes.


<span style="color:blue;font-size:1.25em">**Easy**</span>

<span style="color:red;font-size:1.25em">**No**</span> account needed

Unlike regular Helix you don't need to sign up for a Grams' account. This means no entry fee, no pgp key verification, and no link to you (even your online identity) at all. There are no options with Helix Light which makes for simple and fast bitcoin cleaning.
