Bitp.it (pronounced bit pit) is a Bitcoin mining pool where members can work together to solve blocks.

First launched June 12th, 2011, bitp.it chose to forgo the conventional route of pushpool due to it's numerous bugs and lack of scalability.

Its owners disappeared suddenly at the end of 2011.

##Overview

Bitp.it utilizes the ESMPPS reward scheme to ensure fair payment in a PPS fashion, while avoiding the risk of paying out more than the pool.
