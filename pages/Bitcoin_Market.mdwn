The **Bitcoin Market** is a [[bitcoin]] [[currency_exchange]] site owned and operated by dwdollar. It supports [[PayPal]], Moneybookers, [[Pecunix]], and [[Liberty_Reserve]]. Currently, due to PayPal chargeback issues, registration is closed. Users who have gained some trust on the [[Bitcoin_forum]] can contact dwdollar for an account. Unlike [[MtGox]], exchanges are done directly between individual users, with Bitcoin Market escrowing the bitcoin funds.

The market's trading hours are between 9:00AM until 6:00PM, EDT seven days a week.

Trading on the site began February 6th, 2010 (1.1)

A major update to the site is being tested and March 1st is when its release is planned.  Among the changes are: smaller minimum trade size, 24 X 7 trading, and some steps to help ensure that payment will be made for trades that execute.

Important information can also be gained from the Bitcoin Market website homepage which shows a graph of the Bitcoin exchange rate (to US Dollars). This data is also offered in the JSON format.
