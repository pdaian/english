**[Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com)** is a [Cyprus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) based company, launched in November 2013. It's mission is to provide bitcoin related services through a **simple** and **fast** web interface and it's [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).

## Blockchain Explorer

### Web Interface

**[Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com)** provides a [[blockchain explorer|Block_chain_browser]] which can be used to view information about bitcoin [[blocks|Blocks]], [[transactions|Transactions]] and [[addresses|Address]] that exist on the bitcoin network. It's usage is extremely simple and it's achieved through the clean interface which the website provides. In addition, a **unified search** is provided in order a user to easily find what he is looking for.

### Testnet

As of December 10th, **[Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com)**  has added [testnet](https://www.biteasy.com/testnet/blocks) support to it's Blockexplorer, which now gives you the ability to easily switch between that and [mainnet](https://www.biteasy.com/blockchain/blocks) as well.

### REST API

Except the web interface, [developers](https://www.biteasy.com/developers) can access the blockexplorer data (for both [[mainnet|Mainnet]] and [[testnet|Testnet]]) through the **REST API**. The API is *free* to use, but in order to ensure the quality of the service, a global limit has been set. There is also the option to lift that limit through the use API keys which the developer can acquire by [contacting Biteasy.com](https://www.biteasy.com/support) first.
