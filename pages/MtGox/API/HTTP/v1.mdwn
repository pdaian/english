### Merchant System

#### Order Creation

https://mtgox.com/api/1/generic/private/merchant/order/create

##### Required Parameters:

* **currency**: *<currency>* (for now only BTC is supported)
* **amount**: *<amount as float>*
or

* **amount_int**: *<amount as int>*
* **return_success**: *<string>* Where to redirect the user on payment success
* **return_failure**: *<string>* Where to redirect the user on cancellation

##### Optional Parameters:

* **description**: *<string>* A small description that will appear on the payment page (defaults to "Payment to <user_login>")
* **ipn**: *<string>* URL that will be called by our services once the payment is complete (more below)
* **data**: *<string>* Custom data returned by the IPN

##### Returns

* **transaction**: *<uuid>* A unique transaction ID
* **payment_url**: *<string>* URL on which to redirect the user


#### IPN
The IPN (Instant payment notification) is a mechanism that POST data about a successful payment an a custom URL located on your website right after the payment as been validated. It is signed with your API key.
Your website is supposed then to either acknowledge the IPN by returning "[[OK]]" as is. Anything else will be counted as an error and the system will try sending the IPN back every 30 minutes until it succeed.

##### Content

The IPN POST data will always contain the following:

* **id**: *<uuid>* The transaction ID generated by the initial call
* **payment_id**: *<uuid>* The payment ID
* **status**: *<enum>* Either **paid**, **partial**, **cancelled** or **closed** (4th one shouldn't happen)

If the status is **partial**, the user choose to pay without a MtGox account and bitcoins where detected on the network, we then send you an IPN telling you the amount of bitcoins pending and valid, pending bitcoins have less than 6 confirmations so it is up to you to accept or not the transaction based on that value. Your merchant account will be credited only after the 6 confirmations on our end.

Additional content of the **partial** IPN:

* **amount_pending**: *<amount as int>* The amount still pending confirmations
* **amount_valid**: *<amount as int>* The amount of bitcoins for which we had 6 confirmations
* **amount_total**: *<amount as int>* The total amount, pending and valid, on the payment address

If the status is **paid**:

* **amount**: *<amount as int>* The amount paid by the user
* **currency**: *<currency>* The currency used to pay (should always be BTC for now)
* **method**: *<enum>* The payment method, for now MTGOXBTC
* **date**: *<date>* The payment date

If data was provided in the initial call:

* **data**: *<string>* The data provided when creating the transaction

##### Signature

IPNs are now signed with the user secret like the original query to prevent fraudulents IPNs
Two headers are added to the request:

* **HTTP_REST_KEY**: *<uuid>* The ReST key used for the query
* **HTTP_REST_SIGN**: *<string>* The IPN signature

**HTTP_REST_SIGN** is a base64 encoded sha512 HMAC of the post data using your ReST secret as a key.

See below for examples:

#### PHP
<source lang="php">
<?php

function mtgox_is_valid_ipn() {
	$secret = *;
	$raw_post_data = file_get_contents("php://input");
	$good_sign = hash_hmac('sha512', $raw_post_data, base64_decode($secret), true);
	$sign = base64_decode($_SERVER[['HTTP_REST_SIGN']]);
	return ($sign == $good_sign);
}
