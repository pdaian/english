**20/08/2013 SEPA Withdrawls Much Faster**

An update today in IRC from MagicalTux regarding SEPA transfers:




**05/08/2013 Gox Update (Includes announcements for LTC, New Trade Engines, Deposits and Withdrawls and Hardware Updates**

https://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130805.html


**03/08/2013 Tips for Withdrawls (Thanks Sturles from IRC)**

You can withdraw JPY same day to a domestic Japanese bank account. I'm led to believe that anyone can get a bank account in Japan. Great option if you really need your Gox money now.


**24/07/2013 Additional Clarification on current withdrawls from MtGox**

*International Transfers* - Right now larger transfers of 5 digits or more are receiving priority over smaller transfers. Should you have multiple withdrawls underway, the value of these are added together and considered for this transfer priority.

*SEPA Transfers* - There are no official delays on SEPA transfers but, due to banking limits, larger transfers may still experience delays.


**24/07/2013 Litecoin in July?**

Extract from MtGox channel regarding Litecoin implementation in July.

[[06:32]] <xxxxx> MagicalTux is Mt.Gox still aiming to release Litecoin in July?

[[06:38]] <marionxd> xxxxx: no


This should not be taken as a never, however, simply that it won't be in July. For clarification, 'marionxd' is an MtGox employee.

## Websocket / API Changes

**26/07/2013 API Change**

For anyone calling ticker/etc directly from https://mtgox.com/api/* or https://mtgox.com/code/* now you are going through a proxy, and not directly to MtGox anymore. It is strongly suggested to switch to data.mtgox.com


**08/07/2013 Websocket Changes**

A new field has been added to the user_order broadcast. The field is called 'reason'. This field tells you exactly why an order has been removed from the order book. These are:

> * "requested" for when the customer manually requested the order to be cancelled
> * "completed_active" for orders that complete instantly (market orders and invalid orders)
> * "complete_passive" for limit orders


## Trading Questions

**Q. Is there a limit to open orders per account?**

Yes, 200. 


**Q. How are people submitting the same order on all currency trading books?**

They aren't. There is only one order book, the orders you see on one currency specific order book are also on all currency order books. There is a 2.5% currency conversion fee (added into the price). Eg. If someone buys in GBP from someone selling their BTC in EUR then the price of the EUR order appears in the order book as the price converted to GBP+2.5%.


## Deposits

Funds deposited with Mt.Gox must come from the bank account with the name that matches the owner of the Mt.Gox account.  Furthermore, funds may only be withdrawn to an account that is under the Mt.Gox account owner`s own name, except where transferring Bitcoins or other non-fiat currencies.


## Withdrawls

**Q. What's the process of transferring BTC out of mt.gox into to another person's wallet?**

You buy btcs with your currency then goto https://mtgox.com/trade/funding-options#withdraw, choose Bitcoins


**Q. How much does it cost to withdraw from Mt Gox?**

http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10207/around-eur-40-to-withdraw-from-mtgox


**Q. How long does it take to receive money when withdrawing using SEPA?**

The limits on mtgox's polish bank account limit the volume of SEPA transfers they do, so you might be stuck in the queue for a while, especially with larger transfers. If you need the money fast, use international transfer option.


**Q. Is okpay withdrawal still viable / working? (Added 24/06/2013)**

No. Even though this option is currently on the website, it will give you an error stating this method is not available anymore.


## Verification

**Q. How do I verify with no utility bills?**

A "certificate of residence" would do in this instance. If it is not in english, it may require an official translation to be accompanied with it.


## Website Related Info

**Q. I keep getting a 50x error everytime I log in. If i press F5 the page loads fine, what can I do?**

This is caused by a local caching issue. If you log out, clear your cookies, this should fix the issue going forward.

**04/07/2013 [All Withdrawls Resume!](https://mtgox.com/press_release_20130704.html)

Additional quotes from MtGox (MagicalTux):

**Q. Is mtgox still manually doing trades or are we back to auto trades now but still up to 2 weeks clearing backlog?**

*A. We're still working with the new bank on initial setup, and because of the volume we have, they asked to not overflow them with requests since day 1*

**Q. Was it all withdrawls that were frozen or just ones to USA?**

*A. We're switching **all** withdrawals to the new banks, causing delays for same reason as 1)*
