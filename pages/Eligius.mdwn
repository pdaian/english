**Eligius**, also sometimes referred to as Éloi or "Luke-Jr's pool", is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]].

To use it, a miner merely needs to be directed to mining.eligius.st on port 8337, with the username set to a valid bitcoin address (which receives the payout). **No registration is needed.**

Basic concepts:

* Pool keeps all transaction fees to itself, plus 0.00000001 BTC per second since last-found block and 1 share per block (currently this works out to under 0.0003%, and gets smaller with more miners in the pool).
* Remaining reward is divided equally among ALL shares contributed since its last-found block.
* When a block is found, the miner is paid for that block immediately as a Generated transaction, but only if his total balance is over 1 BTC (to help the recipient avoid transaction fees).
* If a block is orphaned, its shares become part of the next block's reward distribution.
* No registration. Just send username with the address you want payouts to (password can be anything).
* Will only include transactions in its blocks if the sender pays a fee of at least 0.00004096 BTC per 512 bytes.

Eligius was announced on April 27, 2011 (1.1).  At the time the service was operated without a name, paying out even tiny coins immediately.
