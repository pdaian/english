**Eligius**, also sometimes referred to as Éloi or "[[Luke-Jr's|Luke_Dashjr]] pool", is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]].
As of October 23, 2012, Eligius is maintained by [wizkid057](User:Wizkid057).  (1.1)

To use it, a miner merely needs to be directed to mining.eligius.st on port 8337, with the username set to a valid bitcoin address (which receives the payout). **No registration is needed.**

Basic concepts:

* The pool charges no fees and shares are managed under the [CPPSRB](http://eligius.st/wiki/index.php/Capped_PPS#CPPS_with_Recent_Backpay_.28CPPSRB.29) reward system at 100% value at the time of mining.  (1.2)
* When a block is found, all miners who have reached the minimum payout threshold (currently about 0.17 BTC) are paid via the Generation transaction.
* The pool almost never has miner's funds, as they are paid directly to the miners from the block reward.
* If a block is orphaned, its shares become part of the next block's reward distribution.
* No registration. Just send username with the address you want payouts to (password can be anything).

Eligius was announced on April 27, 2011 (1.3).  At the time the service was operated without a name, paying out even tiny coins immediately.
