### Update

* The Snowcron Bitcoin Engine is now available for download from [estore.snowcron.com](http://estore.snowcron.com)
* At the moment it can work with Bitcoin or PayPal (to receive PP payments, you need to have PP business account)
* After you installed the Engine on your site, you can run an online store, or you can provide a service 
	(of running an online store) to other people.
	

### How It Works

* User provides sufficient number of Bitcoin addresses. A number that is required depends on the expected sales volume. 
* User provides registration info for each product.
* A customizable "Pay with Bitcoins" button (or a text link) is placed at user's web site. The Snowcron site has a button generator to make task easier.
* When a customer clicks the "buy" button, he is asked to provide an e.mail address, and then receives a Bitcoin address (one from the list provided by the user of a service).
* Once payment to that address is confirmed, Snowcron sends an e.mail with the purchase information to a customer's e.mail.

### Security Details

* Payments are performed to user provided addresses, therefore, stealing from Snowcron is not possible.

### Technical Details

* A typical code for Snowcron button is plain HTML and can be customized in any text editor:

<pre> 
<a href="https://snowcron.com/bitcoin_user.cgi?
	request_type=PayStep1&user_id=1&item_id=3">
	<img src="https://snowcron.com/images/bitcoin_btn.png" border="0"></a>
</pre>
