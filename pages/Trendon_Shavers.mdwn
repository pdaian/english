[Pirateat40](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=35827) AKA Pirate AKA Trendon Shavers.

Operator of the largest scam in bitcoin history - he operated a [ponzi scheme](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50822.0) which initially promised a guaranteed a daily profit of 1%, and then disappeared with an unknown amount of bitcoins on August 2012. Thoughts were that the amount was about 500,000 bitcoins, estimated worth around $5,000,000 at the time. But these amounts were soon quashed once unofficial forum investigators realised a large hoard of Bitcoin found in their analysis did not belong to Pirate, but belonged to a blackmarket website in which Pirate used to mix his funds to hide the actual amounts he held/stolen.
