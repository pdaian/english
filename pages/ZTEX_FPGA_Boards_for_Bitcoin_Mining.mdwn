ZTEX is a manufacturer of FPGA boards. ZTEX offers the 
[USB-FPGA Module 1.15x](http://www.ztex.de/usb-fpga-1/usb-fpga-1.15x.e.html)
which is optimized for cryptographic computations like Bitcoin Mining. 

This FPGA Board has on-board voltage regulators and an USB interface which is used for
communication and device programming. Low cost
FPGA mining rigs can be build using standard components (USB hubs, USB cables, ATX PSU's).

With the current version of the [[BTCMiner]] this FPGA Board achieves an average hash rate of 210 MH/s. Power dissipation is 9.4 W at 210 MHz.

Current prices including volume prices are stated at the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49180).
