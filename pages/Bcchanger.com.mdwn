Bcchanger.com is an anonymous person-to-person bitcoin exchange where you can buy or sell Bitcoins directly with other members. The site supports multiple currencies and on-the-fly conversion to local currency. 

There is also a feedback system for rating buyers and sellers.

The site is a scammers dream, there is no validation of how many bitcoins a seller has, the feedback system can be artificially inflated in seconds and the sites admin is useless at best.

Multiple transaction methods are available, including:

* PayPal
* MoneyBookers
* GoogleCheckout
* Alert Pay
* Bank Transfer
* And "Other"
