###PayPal
	
[You can't directly buy Bitcoins using PayPal](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2293/how-can-i-buy-bitcoin-via-a-credit-card-or-paypal), because it is risky for the seller, and therefore few sellers will offer this. There are basically 3 reasons for that:
	
* The buyer of bitcoins can always perform a chargeback and there is no way for the seller to contest that
	
* There are many hacked accounts and when PayPal realizes that such an account has been fraudulently used, they will also perform a chargeback
	
* PayPal doesn't like bitcoin, as the bitcoin network is in direct competition to it. They will ban accounts that have anything to do with Bitcoins, and freeze their balance.
	
Having said that there is a [workaround](http://99bitcoins.com/buying-bitcoins-with-paypal-a-practical-guide/) that can be done in order to use Paypal to buy Bitcoins but it holds within it higher transaction fees. Using the [Virtual World Exchange](http://VirrWox.com) you can buy Second Life Lindens (SLL) with Paypal and then convert your SLL to Bitcoins. This process will charge you transaction fees of around 6% but will let you purchase Bitcoins pretty quickly as opposed to a wire transfer. The reason this method works is because you do not buy Bitcoins with Paypal directly, you only buy SLL with Paypal (which is acceptable by Paypal's TOS) and then exchange your SLL to Bitcoin.
	
**Note**:  If you only want to take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility You can trade CFDs on Bitcoin via Paypal on sites like [AvaTrade](http://Ava-Trade.co.uk) or [Plus500](http://99bitcoins.com/plus500). When trading online your capital may be at risk. Trading CFDs is suitable for more experienced traders.

###Credit Card

###Anonymity
There is a huge demand for buying Bitcoins off the grid due to ever-increasing government regulations and private agency intrusions and discrimination against alternative currencies. 
Due to the possibility of facial recognition cameras at banks and the paper trail involved with credit cards, there are very few options to have high levels of anonymity when buying Bitcoins those ways. DNA, Fingerprints, phone and internet records, audio and video records will not be discussed, but they all are possible tools which attackers could use to uncloak even the stealthiest Bitcoin buyer.
There are a couple known ways, depending on your location, to buy Bitcoins outside of the standard banking system with relatively high anonymity.
Buying locally with cash using a burner or payphone allows a high level of anonymity with the exchange being the weakest link.
Many sellers online will also trade Bitcoins for [[MoneyPak]] codes or other cash-like gift codes which can be bought at a local store with cash.
Another way to buy Bitcoins with a high level of anonymity is by sending cash in the mail.

###Exchanges
