−*** There have been complaints about several core practices at icbit.***−

-The primary complaint involves contract price manipulations that allow larger traders, including the site owner, to make profits from smaller traders regardless of bitcoin price movements. 

The first comprehensive post questioning various practices at icbit is https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=125376.0

Examples of contract manipulations, including screenshots, is included in some complaints, including https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=246845

Complaints directed to the owner of icbit, who also is the principle contributor to this wiki page, include https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173928.0
	
−**Any potential investor should thoroughly understand the issues raised in the complaints. If you are not sure please ask questions in a public forum like bitcointalk.org and do not invest until all questions are answered to your satisfaction.**− (1.1)  (1.2)  (1.3)  (1.4)

ICBIT is a trading website which runs a few markets. Both the Exchange and Futures markets are live now.
	
**ICBIT is not an exchange** since it does not act as a central counterparty. [According to their website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130510221928/https://icbit.se/margincall) users **are totally exposed to counterparty risk from other traders** whose identities are concealed from them; the exchange does not pledge its own assets to back the full extent of the other side of a customer's position -- it pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)".  Traders are not allowed to conduct background or reputation checks of any kind on these anonymous counterparties.  ICBIT recently modified the linked page and it **now contains self-contradictory information,** such as "we do pledge our own assets, it's not always the case" and "your profitable position will be closed" at whatever price the exchange deems convenient rather than value-at-maturity.  Since the exchange pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)" it is, by definition, not the [counterparty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterparty) -- the "loosing [[sic]] traders" are the counterparty.

A third party's blogger's assessment (1.5) of the situation is that "ICBIT it is not acting as a clearing house, nor is it the counterparty to the futures trades it brokers.  There is no clearing house guarantee, and counterparty risk remains largely unknown."  The aforementioned blog also contains a rebuttal from ICBIT.

This site is said<sup>[[source?]]</sup> to be founded by Fireball and [[DeepBit]] by combining best practices in high-performance trading and Bitcoin experience.

## Counterparty risks
The ICBIT site acts as the central intermediary for trades in futures contracts.  It does not act as a final guarantor for the clearing process itself, with the results of the clearing process still ultimately dependent upon the counterparty risk exposure to other traders. Thus, the exchange does not act as a counterparty.

Margin call policy is explained on the [ICBIT website](https://icbit.se/margincall).

## Features
For its currency exchange section ICBIT makes an accent on the following:

* State-of-the-art technologies usage. Instead of using old, slow, polling-based algorithms ICBIT builds atop of the most up to date technologies. Its web trading client is in pure HTML and JavaScript (even compatible with most mobile devices), however it's fully realtime thanks to websockets and AJAX.
* Speed of trading. Bitcoin forum is full of anger against slowness of existing exchanges. ICBIT implements special high performance trading engine and uses high-performance "no SQL" database to eliminate the problem.
* No limits. Most of the existing exchanges put rather restrictive limitations and require users to prove their identity. ICBIT finds this totally unacceptable and does not put any limits at all.

A more detailed thread specific to ICBIT futures market was started  (15.3) in November, 2011. The first closed test of futures market was performed, and work on the new version of web trading client was started.

Finally in January, 2012 the currency exchange section went live  (15.4)

note, Fireball is the owner of icbit and the principle contributor to this webpage. He seems to have a history of 'refunding' bitcoin when there is a threat that improper practices may be exposed. See http://trilema.com/2012/icbitse-the-bucket-shop/ and then note the post at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140484.0 which was apparently made after Fireball returned "~500 BTC".
