−*** There are have been complaints about several core practices at icbit.***−

-The primary complaint involves contract price manipulations that allow larger traders, including the site owner, to make easy profits from smaller traders regardless of bitcoin price movements.  

Documentation of contract manipulations, including screenshots, is included in some of the complaints, including https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=246845 

Complaints directed to the owner of icbit, who also is the principle contributor to this wiki page, include https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173928.0

The owner of icbit has so far refused to publicly answer the most serious complaints and has refused to refund money, in some cases, to those who have lost money due to practices that a reasonable person would not consider acceptable on a financial site. 

−**Any potential investor should understand the issues raised in the complaints. If you are not sure please ask questions in a public forum like bitcointalk.org and do not invest until all questions are answered to your satisfaction.**− (1.1)  (1.2)  (1.3)  (1.4)

ICBIT is a trading website which runs a few markets. Both the Exchange and Futures markets are live now.

This site is said<sup>[[source?]]</sup> to be founded by Fireball and [[DeepBit]] by combining best practices in high-performance trading and Bitcoin experience.

**ICBIT is not an exchange** since it does not act as a central counterparty. [According to their website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130510221928/https://icbit.se/margincall) users **are totally exposed to counterparty risk from other traders** whose identities are concealed from them; the exchange does not pledge its own assets to back the full extent of the other side of a customer's position -- it pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)".  Traders are not allowed to conduct background or reputation checks of any kind on these anonymous counterparties.  ICBIT recently modified the linked page and it **now contains self-contradictory information,** such as "we do pledge our own assets, it's not always the case" and "your profitable position will be closed" at whatever price the exchange deems convenient rather than value-at-maturity.  Since the exchange pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)" it is, by definition, not the [counterparty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterparty) -- the "loosing [[sic]] traders" are the counterparty.

## Features
For its currency exchange section ICBIT makes an accent on the following:

* State-of-the-art technologies usage. Instead of using old, slow, polling-based algorithms ICBIT builds atop of the most up to date technologies. Its web trading client is in pure HTML and JavaScript (even compatible with most mobile devices), however it's fully realtime thanks to websockets and AJAX.
* Speed of trading. Bitcoin forum is full of anger against slowness of existing exchanges. ICBIT implements special high performance trading engine and uses high-performance "no SQL" database to eliminate the problem.
* No limits. Most of the existing exchanges put rather restrictive limitations and require users to prove their identity. ICBIT finds this totally unacceptable and does not put any limits at all. 
* One problem with this is that some unusual similarities have been observed between several 'different' users, indicating they may be the same user. This becomes an issue when 'several' of these users post on forums in defense of icbit and engage in chat on the icbit website that may be intended simply to draw in customers. 
* One example of this is the 'contango / backwardation' issue involving several users who each use these words improperly, in the same way, on various posts at bitcointalk and on the icbit site. Potential investors can research this simply by searching bitcointalk for these terms and noting when the terms are used in relation to icbit. Neither backwardation nor contango are involved in price variations on the site. **There is no 'proper' use of these terms with regard to the specific contracts as traded at icbit.** Any person with questions or doubts should research these terms and ask questions in a public forum.[(1)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=164255.msg2701891#msg2701891)

## History
First mentions of ICBIT appeared in June and July 2011 in the Bitcoin Stock Exchange Security Standards thread at bitcointalk.org (14.1) and Bitcoin futures market discussion  (14.2). By that time a very first version of the trading engine was developed.

A more detailed thread specific to ICBIT futures market was started  (14.3) in November, 2011. The first closed test of futures market was performed, and work on the new version of web trading client was started.

Finally in January, 2012 the currency exchange section went live  (14.4)

In 2012 there were initial reports of possible unethical practices at icbit, culminating in a detailed exposé by a competitor of icbit.  (14.5)

In 2013 complaints increased, including those linked on this wiki and several more. 

As of late September 2013 the owner of icbit, Fireball, continues to avoid responsibility for what are widely regarded as questionable practices. He daily edits this wiki (see "View History" tab above) to remove any information that is not favorable. Still some traders hope he will reform, settle his bad accounts and work to create an honest site **or have the decency to shut down.**
