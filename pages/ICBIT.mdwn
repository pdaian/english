ICBIT is a trading website which runs a few markets. Both the Exchange and Futures markets are live now.

This site is said<sup>[[source?]]</sup> to be founded by Fireball and [[DeepBit]] by combining best practices in high-performance trading and Bitcoin experience.

ICBIT Exchange acts as a central counterparty for all trades however [according to their website](https://icbit.se/margincall) users could be exposed to risk of traders going bankrupt; the exchange may [pledge its own assets](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50817.msg1402414#msg1402414) to back the other side of a customer's position, however it's not always the case. Traders are not allowed to conduct any background or reputation checks of other traders.

## Features
For its currency exchange section ICBIT makes an accent on the following:

* State-of-the-art technologies usage. Instead of using old, slow, polling-based algorithms ICBIT builds atop of the most up to date technologies. Its web trading client is in pure HTML and JavaScript (even compatible with most mobile devices), however it's fully realtime thanks to websockets and AJAX.
* Speed of trading. Bitcoin forum is full of anger against slowness of existing exchanges. ICBIT implements special high performance trading engine and uses high-performance "no SQL" database to eliminate the problem.
* No limits. Most of the existing exchanges put rather restrictive limitations and require users to prove their identity. ICBIT finds this totally unacceptable and does not put any limits at all.
