**CoinCard** is an exchange where bitcoins can be traded for virtual prepaid cards.

Payment is delivered nearly instantly after payment has [[confirmed|confirmation]].  CoinCard uses 2 blocks as the confirmation threshold.

The site was first publicly available on Feburary 25, 2011 (1.1).  On April 30, 2011 the exchange's operator stopped cashing out to PayPal after the payment network froze the exchange's PayPal account (1.2).  

The site resumed service on December 20, 2011 (1.3).

The operator of the site previously operated [[CoinPal]] for [[buying_bitcoins]].
