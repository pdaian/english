Bitcoin Navigator is a Google Maps-based visual directory of physical locations which accept and deal with Bitcoins. 

The creators of Bitcoin Navigator felt that as the number of physical places that accept Bitcoins has grown, other locator services have listed bitcoin users side by side with stores and locations which has made the maps cluttered and difficult to navigate. With the lead up to the Bitcoin conference in New York City, they thought it would be a good idea to create a site with the sole purpose of listing local businesses that accept bitcoin.

Visitors can inform the site operators of new bitcoin-accepting spots for inclusion into the directory via a contact form on the site.
