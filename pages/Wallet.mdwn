A Bitcoin **wallet** is a file that contains a collection of private keys. 

### Bitcoin Qt

The original Bitcoin client wallet file is named **wallet.dat** and contains (2.1):

* keypairs for each of your [[addresses|address]]
* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]
* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.

The data file for the wallet is wallet.dat and is located in the [[Bitcoin data directory|data_directory]].

It is intended that a wallet be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time.  Attempting to clone a wallet for use on multiple computers will result in "weird behavior" (2.2).

The format of this file is Berkeley DB.  Tools that can manipulate wallet files include [[pywallet]].

### Armory

The Armory client uses a custom [binary wallet format](http://bitcoinarmory.com/developers/armory-wallet-files/).

### Blockchain.info

Blockchain.info use a plain text JSON wallet format documented [here](https://blockchain.info/wallet/wallet-format). Private keys Keys are stored in base58.

### [[Coinkite]]

[[!img "Coinkite.gif" size=20x20 link=https://coinkite.com]] [Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/promo/wiki) is the only web wallet using ["HD Wallet (BIP32)"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032) technology, which can be shared partially or entirely with different systems, each with or without the ability to spend coins  [here](https://coinkite.com/faq). Private keys Keys are sent to you encrypted with AES-256-CBC.

### Multibit

Multibit uses the bitcoinj [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) wallet file.

### [[Bitcoin_Wallet]]

Bitcoin Wallet uses the bitcoinj [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) format for its wallet file. However, due to Android isolation of applications, it is impossible to access the wallet file as a non-root user.

### Email Tip Bot

[Email Tip Bot](http://emailtipbot.com) is a wallet that works entirely through email. This makes it the only native solution to sending bitcoins on iOS devices, like the iPhone and iPad. It is secure against email spoofing, but can be compromised by anyone who has read access to your email.
