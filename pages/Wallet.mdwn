A Bitcoin **wallet** contains (1.1):

* your keypairs for each [[addresses|address]]
* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]

The data file for the wallet is wallet.dat and is located in the Bitcoin [[data_directory]].

It is intended that a wallet be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time.  Attempting to clone a wallet for use on multiple computers will result in "weird behavior" (1.2).
