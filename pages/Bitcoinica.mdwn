An exchange that allows speculation on the Bitcoin to USD (BTC/USD) exchange rate using leverage.

The default margin requirement level is 2.5:1 (1.1).  The level may raised to 5:1 (or higher) using the self-service settings function.

The service charges no trading fees but instead earns from the trading spread -- similar to how forex trading functions.
	
Caution is recommended for those not familiar with leverage and/or forex trading.

Funds may be added in the form of either MTGUSD or Bitcoins.  Leverage from funds added using bitcoins can purchase an even larger Bitcoin (long) position (1.2).  Similarly, funds added using USDs can be used to sell (short) bitcoins without already having bitcoins.

The site does not yet provide a terms of service and it is not known from which jurisdiction the service operates.

##History

The service was launched on September 8, 2011 (16.1).  On March 1st, 2012 the site suffered a significant financial loss when a web hosting had an internal security breach that gave the attacker access to a wallet in which Bitcoinica stored funds.  More than 43K bitcoins were stolen by the attacker.  The operator provided a statement that reserves were sufficient to cover the loss (16.2).
