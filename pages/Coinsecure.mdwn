They launched [coinsecure.info](https://coinsecure.info) India's first Bitcoin to INR based [[Block chain|Bitcoin#Block_chain]] Explorer (1.2) (1.3)

“We are days away from launching a powerful tool to help people from across India enable themselves with Bitcoin. We have been in development mode over the past few months and thanks to a stellar team, we have a secure, fast and easy Exchange in place. We had earlier launched [coinsecure.info](https://coinsecure.info) – a block explorer aimed at India, a [Paperwallet](https://paperwallet.coinsecure.info/) Service and [news.coinsecure.in](http://news.coinsecure.in) – a news portal that aggregates news about Bitcoin in India.”

“Bitcoin will fit in as a global mode of payment. It will be the sole currency and not valued by the fiat. Whether online or off-line commerce or just holding Bitcoin, the freedom of being your own bank is unbeatable. The freedom of government and banks not controlling our money, we thought we would never have, is now here and it’s Bitcoin. It’s an opportunity for people in rural places with no banks to hold and protect their money with no registration or saving fees at all.”
~ Mohit Kalra, CEO & Co-founder of Coinsecure - Exclusive: An Interview With the Coinsecure Team - newsbtc.com 

##Trade Engine

“Our trade engine is now the focus for us at the moment, as we get a tool to finally direct people who want to get involved with Bitcoin. We launched as a mock trading exchange where each user is given test rupees and test Bitcoin. In order to make this a bit more interesting, we are rewarding the top 20 user balances at the end of its first month. It is still very early for India and we are hoping to see a lot more active participation through 2015.” Benson Samuel

After success of Mock Bitcoin trade engine for 1 month in December 2014, Coinsecure's Trade Engine went live and began accepting real time Bitcoin trades and INR deposits since January 2015. (2.1)

##Beyond currency – Blockchain

“Record keeping, mass surveys, population census, railway ticket authentication, the list is endless in terms of how India can leverage Blockchain technology. Several corporates and groups are already looking into maintaining their internal ledger on a Blockchain.”
~ Benson Samuel suggests some possibilities, however wild it may seem now.
