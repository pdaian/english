Bitcoin API call list (as of version 0.8.0)

## Common operations

### Listing my bitcoin addresses

Listing the bitcoin [[addresses|address]] in your wallet is easily done via *listreceivedbyaddress*. It normally lists only addresses which already have received transactions, however you can list all the addresses by setting the first argument to 0, and the second one to true.

[[Accounts|accounts_explained]] are used to organize addresses.

## Full list

Required arguments are denoted inside &lt; and &gt; Optional arguments are inside  [[and]].

##Error Codes

I don't see a list of error codes, so I figured I could just paste them here, or on some other page as I find them.



|Raw |Error  |Code |Notes
|---|---|---|---
|{[value is type str, expected real](Error:)code: -1 }|value is type str, expected real |-1
|{[Invalid amount](Error:)code: -3 }|Invalid amount |-3
|{[Insufficient funds](Error:)code: -4 }|Insufficient funds |-4 |seems to happen when they need to pay a fee
