# User Guide

* Connect your laptop to the eithernet port of the Avalon
* Setup your laptop IP address 192.168.0.101
* Open http://192.168.0.100
* Make sure WR703N can access Internet, Configure WiFi:  Network -> WIFI -> Scan(select your WIFI network) -> Join Network -> WPA passphrase -> Submit -> Save & Apply for connect to WIFI Internet
* setup your mining worker: Status -> Cgminer Configuration. 
* Restart the cgminer service:  System -> Startup, 
* Check your avalon status:  Status -> Cgminer Status
* Setup password/using ssh
	ssh root@192.168.0.100 # Once you setup the password the telnet service will be stop. use ssh instead.

## Cgminer option
**--avalon-options 115200:24:10:45:282**. this is the default avalon option. here is the details:
	**115200**: the serial baud. this have to match the controller baud.
	**24**: the miner count.(there are 3 modulars in avalon. each modular have 8 miners), if your avalon have 4 modulars. change it to 32
	**10**: the chip count pre miner.
	**45**: the controller timeout parameter. the valid number: 50, 47, 45, 40.
	**282**: the chip clock. the valid number: 256, 270, 282, 300.

## Run cgminer manually
In case you need to run Cgminer in linux console please run the following command:

* Restart Cgminer:
	# /etc/init.d/cgminer restart

If your avalon does not mine properly, please run Cgminer in debug mode with -D --verbose option. For example:
	# cgminer -S /dev/ttyUSB0 -o stratum.btcguild.com:3333 -O xxxx:yyyy -D --verbose --avalon-options 115200:24:10:45:282 --api-allow "W:0/0" --api-listen 2>/tmp/cgminer-debug.log

## TP-LINK TL-WR703N
There is a modify version of TP-LINK TP-WR703N inside Avalon. cgminer running at 703n, this 703n have 64MB ram and modified power supply. it power from the usb-client side(we moved a 0R resistor from **J1** to **R113** for that)

Why there is a ugly USB HUB there?  you can find more information about AR9331's usb stability issue [here](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39956).

### How to reflash

1. Download latest Avalon [image](http://downloads.qi-hardware.com/people/xiangfu/avalon/latest/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin) to your PC.
1. Goto:
	System -> Backup / Flash Firmware -> Flash new firmware image (make sure **Keep settings** is checked)

1. Select the image you just download. then compare the md5 in next page. if everything fine. click **Proceed**

**Attention:** To avoid your WR703N become a brick, during flash your WR703N be careful DO NOT power off avalon, and DO NOT break your network connection. Just wait there till you see OpenWrt login web page again.

**Attention:** If not essential please do not re-Flash your Avalon. Because not all of WR703N issue could be resolved by reset button. If you want to play WR703N I would like to recommend you order a standalone TP-LINK WR703N from ebay or somewhere for studying purpose.

## WIFI or Ethernet Cable ?
Avalon shipped with a 9db antenna after connect it to WR703N usually could establish good wireless connection with your WIFI router. But if for some reason you would like to use Ethernet Cable to connect Avalon with your network, please login OpenWrt and configure the LAN port:
	Network -> Interfaces -> LAN -> Edit -> Common Configuration -> General Setup
	Disable the DHCP on Lan port

**Attention:** You need to configure it correctly based on your own network enviroment. If anything wrong you might could not access your WR703N any more.

## Start to mine
To maximize your Avalon miner's performance, it is recommended that you choose pools with the stratum protocol supported. The default mining pool configured in Avalon is ozco.in. To change it login to OpenWrt:
	Status -> Cgminer Configuration
	Click "Save & Apply" to save your update and restart cgminer immediately

Currently the stratum pools that could work stable with Avalon are:

* [50BTC.com](http://50btc.com/)
* [Solo mining with Eloipool](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=158105.0)
* [BitMinter](http://bitminter.com)
* [Eligius](http://eligius.st)
* [Ozcoin](https://www.ozcoin.net)
* [btcguild](http://www.btcguild.com)
* [slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz)
* [Triplemining](http://www.triplemining.com)

To get more information about how to configure specific pools, please check their website. If you run multiple Avalons, we recommend that you create a dedicated worker for each of them. This will make it easier to monitor your Avalons through the pool's website and identify possible problems.

## FPGA controller
### V1.0 ~ V1.2
About **P5** jumper: close this jumper will supply 5V to the USB-B port. in this system, the controller board power the 703N from the client side. if you connect the controller itself to a PC, you better remove the jumper.

### V1.5
 [[!img "Avalon_fpga_controller_v1.5.jpg" size=160x160]]  [[!img "Avalon_fpga_controller_v1.5_usb_hub.jpg" size=160x160]]

* Remove the **[F1(Fuse)](http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/13207881/1024/Anonymous/avf1.png)** for fix the USB-HUB chip overheat, 
1. if you are batch2 user and your received Avalon between **Apr 26 2013 ~ May 31 2013**
1. the FPGA controller is **1.5**
1. your FPGA contoller board still have **F1 mounted**
you need do this by yourself.  removing F1 will not make the usb hub stop working, F1 powers the USB-A1 plug (which is normally unused), more info please checkout [here](https://github.com/BitSyncom/avalon-ref/issues/5)

### V1.51

* Fixed USB-HUB chip overheat, NO NEEDS remove F1 anymore

### V1.61
 [[!img "Avalon_batch3_V1.61_detail.png" size=160x160]]  [[!img "Avalon_batch3_V1.61_detail1.png" size=160x160]]

* Some of batch3 macine will use new case and V1.61 FPGA controller (all new case have V1.61 FPGA controller)
* New temperature sensors, mounted on PCB.
* Move the Fan power from FPGA controller to PDU. reduce the interference.
* Please DO NOT flash old fpga controller firmware to V1.61 controller board (new batch3 machine). it may make your Avalon not working.
* LEDs
	Left: Green --> Power-on, Red --> PSU issue, OFF: --> No power 
	Right: Yellow --> FPGA Buffer empty(no task send out to fpga), OFF --> FPGA Buffer full(means mining)

### Issues

* If kernel cannot detect the ft232 chip. The probability is the QFN ft232 chip have soldering problem. then you need do a re-work on this FT232 QFN chip.
* The task buffer LED never on.(Should be light when power on. off when cgminer start working). below is the correct led cable connector:

## P2Pool Operation with Avalon

Doing anything special is no longer required as of commit 11d63ef66. Since the recent P2Pool hardfork, dead-on-arrival rates of about 6% or more are normal. GPU rates are usually (1-2%). Mining with Avalons on P2Pool is nearly as efficient as solo mining.

## About [usb 1-1: clear tt 1 (8030) error -71]
	Not all 703n have this problem. ignore this section if you never meet this error

* There is a power issue with the 703N, The 703N is drawing to much power it caused the USB HUB chip on [Bitcointalk users Senseless](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=32660)'s FPGA controller to nearly destroy itself. See the destruction [here](http://www.mysenselesslife.com/avalon/DSCN5212.JPG)

* In order to fix it you need had to **power down the WiFi modem by disable it**, use Eithernet instead. The kernel no long report -71 errors. thanks to [Bitcointalk user Senseless](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=32660) and others who help on identify the issue.

* If your avalon was far away from your router. eithernet cable not fit. you may want try those kind of devices

## Others

* There is a pair of gloves in Avalon package. please put it on when assembling or carrying.

* About the plastic sheets: please **remove them BEFORE** mining. we design the case as a part of heatsink, so remove the plastic sheets is a must

* About FAN change: **DO NOT** change the fans to a low speed model. will cause over heat. **DO NOT** install extra fans at the rear "fan socket". will cause PSU over heat and nearly useless for module cooling.

* About install extra heat-sinks on each avalon chip: please do not do that. there is a air gap between the die and package top, install a heatsink on chip is useless. and will cause overheating. because  the top PCB copper act as a heatsink too. do not cover them.

* About water cooling: yes, do it.

* If you are overclocking, even just a little, and your Avalon stops functioning, and there are no visible signs of heat-related damage, consider testing and/or replacing the power supply. You should probably not be overclocking without a replacement PSU anyway. Make sure PSU is rated for 750W or more (if overclocking.)

* Add overclock code
* Change the cgminer configure to UCI system
* Add the simple web ui

##20130117

* Update OpenWRt to r35097
* Update cgminer to 2.10.4
* Remove /www/miner.php, change cgminer cron job to */5
* Start ntpd before start cgminer

## Test Plan

* New firmware don't break Avalon for sure
* New firmware don't use all flash. have to keep some space for save configuration
* Either and WiFI connect works fine
* Cgminer works fine(the kernel user driver, cgminer it self, cgminer-monitor and uci configurations files)
* After configure cgminer. [& Apply](Save) can restart the cgminer
* The Status/API log page works fine
* Test mining
* Test the cgminer-monitor
* Make sure 80/22/4028 open on WAN.

## Unofficial Firmware

* [Untested BFGMiner 3.0 alpha1 for Avalon](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=78192.msg1566545#msg1566545)

# How to Compile Your Own Firmware for Avalon
1. First check if you have met the building prerequisites. Checkout this page first [OpenWrt Buildroot – Installation](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence)

For example, if your OS is Ubuntu/Debian, install the required packages like this:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install  gawk flex quilt xsltproc  unzip subversion git-core build-essential libxml-parser-perl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev liblua5.1-0-dev

2. Now get the source code, prepare the code and build. **this needs ~6GB**
	wget https://raw.github.com/BitSyncom/avalon-extras/master/scripts/build-avalon-image.sh
	chmod +x build-avalon-image.sh
	./build-avalon-image.sh --clone #prepare the code and build, **ONLY NEED ONCE**
	./build-avalon-image.sh

3. Update all repos
	./build-avalon-image.sh --update

4. Only rebuild cgminer
	./build-avalon-image.sh --cgminer

5. Finally you could get the freshly built firmware files under **avalon/bin/**

## Compile with kernel usbmon

* You need apply [this patch](https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-May/020107.html) to your OpenWrt for enable [usbmon](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt)
* Run **make menuconfig** goto  **Kernel modules** --> **USB Support** enable **kmod-usb-mon**
