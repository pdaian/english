The "risks in online banking" for U.S. shows: "Bank wires that originate in phishing can be easily reversed and often are"

The term [[bank_wire]] in the U.S. generally refers to the use of Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's real-time gross settlement system.  Fedwire funds and securities transactions are processed in real time when received by the Fedwire applications and, once settled, are final and irrevocable (2.1).  Even if fraud occurs, there is no method for the sending bank to reverse the transfer.  In practice, after learning of reported fraud the receiving bank may investigate and the result sometimes can result in the return of funds.
