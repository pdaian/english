## https for the google map

When I load the page in chrome it says that the map cannot be loaded, however it loads up just fine after allowing insecure content through (albeit causing the green https to go red and have a nasty red line through it)

## Please use CoinMap

Hi,
please use [CoinMap](http://coinmap.org/#zoom=4&lat=42.39&lon=3.25&layer=OpenStreetMap) instead of the current map.--[Stemby](User:Stemby) ([[talk|User_talk:Stemby]]) 16:33, 1 July 2013 (GMT)
