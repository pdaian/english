itBit is a Venture Capital funded global digital currencies exchange based in Singapore. We match buyers and sellers of Bitcoins vs USD, SGD, and EUR. 

We differentiate ourselves from many of the more consumer-focused exchanges by 

- Committing to a higher level of security and regulatory compliance 

- Using robust industry-standard technology 

- Partnering with an automated market maker for deep liquidity 

- and by being fully transparent in our operations
