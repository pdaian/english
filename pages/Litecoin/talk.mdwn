There is nothing on this discussion page about this article at the moment. Use it. Reasonable informed edits will be allowed through until a consensus is reached and the page unlocked. That is comments that are neither pro or anti litecoin, but are *neutral* and objective. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 10:01, 28 November 2011 (GMT)

## Errors

"Designed to be inefficient on all common computer components" -- this is bogus and false.  Please edit and replace "all common computer components" with "both CPUs and GPUs".

## Siliness

"Considered silver to Bitcoin's gold"... this is a content-free sentence.  In what sense is it "silver"?  Maybe it would be better to simply "inline" the analogy and replace "silver to Bitcoin's gold" with whatever that analogy is trying to mean (I have no idea what that is...)?

## Objectivity please, missing citation

There are two criticisms in the article, that I believe are not objective:

* Mining Monopoly - while I heard claims that Litecoin is volnurable to botnets, I never heard anything about a single monopoloy, or anyone possibly building a "single piece of specialized/custom hardware to overtake all the commodity mining systems combined". Can we have a citation for this, or remove it if no citation is found?
* Pyramid Scheme - The article states, as if it is a fact, that "Litecoin effectively functions as a pyramid scheme". This is hardly objective. Litecoin could possibly become say 1% of the total Bitcoin market, and could indeed function as "silver". The same arguments in [[FAQ#Is_Bitcoin_a_Ponzi_scheme]] apply here.

Can we fix this?
