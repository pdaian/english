An **OpenCL miner** is a bitcoin miner that uses the [OpenCL framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) to perform the [[hashing|hash]] computations. When used with a modern GPU, this can produce hash rates orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with a CPU. 

##Overview

OpenCL is a computing framework which allows programmers to write code which works across a variety of hardware, both CPUs and GPUs included. OpenCL was originally developed by Apple.

The use of an OpenCL miner allows one to hash using a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), which has a vastly larger ability to perform algorithmic calculations than an CPU (Central Processing Unit).

##Requirements

Hashing on a GPU requires an OpenCL compatible ([ATI/AMD](http://developer.amd.com/gpu/AMDAPPSDK/pages/DriverCompatibility.aspx)) or CUDA compatible ([NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html)) graphics card.

The python [[Poclbm]] open source OpenCL bitcoin miner was created by m0mchil (3.1) based on the open source CUDA client originally released by puddinpop (3.2). 

Subsequently the java [[DiabloMiner]] based on m0mchil's was created by Diablo-D3 (3.3). 

Puddinpop has also released a C++ OpenCL client capable of being compiled into the GUI client or daemon, or as a stand alone RPC miner (3.4).

Another miner was released by Jedi95 & CFSworks released [[Phoenix_miner]] (3.5) which can work with memory underclocked to 300MHz and scans whole 2<sup>32</sup> nonce space.

BitTornado is another OpenCL Miner that supports ATI and NVIDIA Cards. It was released by Chris Evans (3.6).

See the [[Mining_Hardware_Comparison]] page for detailed statistics on the hash rates that can be achieved with various hardware.
