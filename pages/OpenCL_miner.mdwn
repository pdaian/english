An **OpenCL miner** is a bitcoin miner that uses the [OpenCL framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) to perform the hashing computations. When used with a modern GPU, this can produce hash rates orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with a CPU. Hashing on a GPU requires an OpenCL or CUDA compatible graphics card ([NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html), [ATI/AMD](http://developer.amd.com/gpu/AMDAPPSDK/pages/DriverCompatibility.aspx)).

The python [[Poclbm]] open source OpenCL bitcoin miner was created by m0mchil (1.1) based on the open source CUDA client originally released by puddinpop (1.2). Subsequently the java [[DiabloMiner]] based on m0mchil's was created by Diablo-D3 (1.3).  Puddinpop has also released a C++ OpenCL client capable of being compiled into the GUI client or daemon, or as a stand alone RPC miner (1.4).

See the [[Mining_Hardware_Comparison]] page for detailed statistics on the hash rates that can be achieved with various hardware.
