##dm-crypt
###Description
Dm-crypt is part of the Linux Kernel. Some distributions might not include it in their kernel configurations, however. It is a lot like TrueCrypt: it allows you to mount encrypted files or partitions and decrypt/encrypt them on-the-fly.
###Manual setup
Your distro probably comes with a tool to simplify using dm-crypt (also see Tomb below). However, here is how you would manually mount a file-hosted dm-crypt volume. The [hashalot](http://www.paranoiacs.org/~sluskyb/hacks/hashalot/) tool is used to prompt you for and process your password. This is used both to create the device and access it:
	losetup /dev/loop0 ~/encrypted
	HASH=`hashalot -s InsertSaltHere sha256  hexdump -e '32/1 "%02x"'`
	echo 0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/loop0` crypt aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 \
	$HASH 0 /dev/loop0 0  dmsetup create dmDevice
	mount /dev/mapper/dmDevice /mnt/encrypted

* Losetup makes the container file (~/encrypted in this case) act like a device.
* The hashalot command prompts you for a password and then hashes it, adding the specified salt. The salt should be random, but it mustn't change.
* The hexdump command puts the binary hashalot output into the format required for dm-crypt
* Dm-crypt is set up on the /dev/loop0 device created by losetup. It uses the password hash created previously. The aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 encryption method is secure, though probably not as secure as Truecrypt's XTS method, which does not appear to be available in official kernel releases as far as I can tell. The dm-crypt device is created as /dev/mapper/dmDevice in this example.
* The device is mounted. Before you do this for the first time, you need to run mke2fs. If you ever enter the wrong password, the device will appear to contain random data and attempting to mount it will fail.

###Examples
Based on Grondilu's [post,](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2458.msg33379#msg33379) to encrypt the wallet, from a terminal in the bitcoin parent directory, type:

openssl enc -aes256 -in ./.bitcoin/wallet.dat -out wallet.aes256

From [Paul Heinlein's](http://www.madboa.com/people/paul/) [openssl command line how to,](http://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/) to decode, add the '-d' option, set the '-in' option to the output file name, to type:

openssl enc -d -aes256 -in wallet.aes256 -out wallet.dat

There is a small shell script that automates the whole process of 1) decrypting wallet 2) launching Bitcoin 3) encrypting the wallet afterwards and cleaning up the unencrypted bits. [bitcoin-launch-script](http://lorelei.kaverit.org/bitcoin.sh)

##CCrypt
###Description
`CCrypt` is a linux command-line utility by Peter Selinger (selinger at [(1)](http://users.sourceforge.net)) that replaces the Unix `crypt` command. `CCrypt` is much more secure than `crypt`, utilizing the same encryption algorithm as AES and SSL (Rijndael block cipher), the algorithm used by the US government and the banking industry. The command line syntax for ccrypt is a bit simpler
###Download
Visit [(1)](http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net)

or in a debian linux flavor just execute

	sudo apt-get install ccrypt

###Examples
To encrypt your wallet:

	ccrypt ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat

To decrypt the file created above:

	ccdecrypt ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat.cpt

or 
	ccrypt -d ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat.cpt

##Tomb
###Description
Tomb is a simple tool to manage encrypted storage on GNU/Linux.

Tomb generates encrypted storage files to be opened and closed using
their associated keyfiles, which are also protected with a password
chosen by the user.

A tomb is like a locked folder that can be safely transported and
hidden in a filesystem; its keys can be kept separate, for instance
keeping the tomb file on your computer harddisk and the key files on a
USB stick.

##xorsplit
###Description
Open-source software for Linux.  xorsplit copies a file into 3 separate 
backup files.  Any two of the backup files are sufficient to reconstruct
the original -- but any one of the files will yield at most half of
the original information (the odd bytes or the even bytes).  
	
Optionally, each of the backup files can be encrypted with a password.

###License
[the donation address remain unchanged.](that)

###Usage
xorsplit file   -- splits the file into file.1, file.2, and file.3

xorsplit-p file -- same, but requesting a password (no password means no encryption)

xorsplit file.3 file.1 outfile   -- combine file.1 and file.3 into outfile.

xorsplit-p file.3 file.1 outfile -- same, after using the password to decrypt
