#### Notability problem
I have problems with the term 'notable' in
	Only notable donation-accepting sites should be added here.
>  this excludes announcing *newly* developed services, which naturally don't have 'notability'.
A solution could be to create another page, or to divide this page into one section with notability and one without. The general problem with this term is, who decides, who has notability and who not?

My use-case is announcing
	[Roll Your Tasks (RYT)](http://www.evolgo.de/RYT/) A free browser based task management app for individuals and small groups. Bitcoin donations welcome.
I would like to have a good place for this announcement (Note: currently it is under [Trade->Productivity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Productivity), but it has been deleted once with the justification, that it is not 'trade' in a tight sense).

## Organizations that provide tax receipts

It would be nice if this page differentiated between organizations that could provide tax receipts and those that cannot. Perhaps a new column in the table would be the best way to do this. The could column list the countries in which the organizations can provide tax receipts.
