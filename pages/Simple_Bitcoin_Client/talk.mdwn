## Things to improve

### Security, for lulz
Learned from late thefts, people will really want easier ways to keep their coins safe. It can be done by discarding the single-wallet paradigm bitcoin is using.

Users need:

* Separate wallets and ways to transfers between them
* Easy encryption (with readymade tools) and access of encrypted wallets
* Wallets on memory sticks
* Possibly yet, an external memory device that can sign transactions with user's approval

### Convenience with ecommerce sites
How people will use bitcoins? They spend them on whatever things they want ex. fuckbuddies and cookies. Buying things is quite common, and you need an easy way to do so.

In simplest form you'll want to catch link clicks on btc://destaddress/amt and ask for user permissions unless an external hardware does that for him.

Another thing is to verify different escrowing services work well with it all. You might want to consider for embedding into browser as an one choice.
