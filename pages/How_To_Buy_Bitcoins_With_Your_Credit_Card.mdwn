## Intro
While it is risky for sellers to offer this option, four services now will allow you to buy bitcoins with your credit card. However, that does not mean it is entirely risk free, if you are from Asia or Africa your funds may be frozen by credit card payment processors for further inspection due to the large amounts of fraud that come from those continents. 

**Note:** If you only want to take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility You can trade CFDs on Bitcoin via a credit card on sites like [AvaTrade](http://Ava-Trade.co.uk) or [Plus500](http://99bitcoins.com/plus500). When trading online your capital may be at risk. Trading CFDs is suitable for more experienced traders.

###Brawker
[Brawker](http://brawker.com) is a platform where bitcoin owners can order anything they want on the Internet and have it paid by someone else in fiat money who will then take the bitcoins in exchange.

- Bitcoin owners can order anything they want on the Internet and get a 6% cash back on their purchase.

- People interested in buying bitcoins can do so by fulfilling someone else's order with their credit card or Paypal account and obtain the equivalent amount in bitcoins.

### VirWox (Paypal)
[The Virtual World Exchange](http://virrwox.com)  also known as VirWox allows you to buy SLL (Second life Lindens) with all major credit cards which you can then exchange to Bitcoins on VirWox itself. [The process](http://99bitcoins.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-with-a-credit-card/) is done through the use of Paypal, so every credit card which Paypal accepts is eligible to be used in this process.

###Western Union
US customers can use Western Union to buy Bitcoins with their credit cards. Unlike Paypal, Western Union will allow you to buy Bitcoins through services such as [CoinMama](http://coin-mama.com/).

### Coin.MX
[Coin.MX - Crypto Money Exchange](http://coin.mx/) - if you are from USA, you can use your credit card to fund your coin.mx account and buy BTC or LTC currencies. Requires verification of identity by posting a video to the site.

## Avoiding Scams
Before using any service it is a good idea to look for reviews and feedback from previous customers. This can be done by simply googling the name of the website or company. The bitcointalk forums are also a good place to find discussions and reviews about services. As far as we know, these are the only two services that can reliably be used to buy bitcoins with your credit card.
