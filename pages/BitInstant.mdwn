BitInstant is a new service that allows you to quickly and easily transfer funds into your online exchange account without delay.
It provides a means to rapidly topup your account at one of several bitcoin exchanges far faster than the usual methods. Many bitcoin exchanges allow deposits of traditional currency such as the US dollar via methods which can be annoyingly slow. In some cases there can be delays of up to a week before the funds you deposit are available at the exchange site for conversion into bitcoins. During this waiting period, as with any currency, exchange rates can fluctuate and you may not get the same amount you would have been able to at the time you begun your deposit.
Bitinstant makes most deposits happen instantly - within a matter of seconds in ideal cases, and in an absolute worst-case scenario they will still aim to have funds into your exchange account before a stated maximum deadline (on average about 30 minutes depending on various conditions).

#Methods of Payment

Currently, top-ups can be funded via [[Dwolla]], [[MtGox]] Coupon Codes, and [[Liberty_Reserve]] with new ones rolling out.
