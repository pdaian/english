This pages gathers resources for the implementation of a Bitcoin wallet on a smart card.

###Rationale

* Computers and smartphones are target for malware. The software on a smart card can be protected.
* Smart cards do not need a battery, nor internet connection, they are robust.
* Adoption: people are already used to paying with smart cards.

###Desired features

* no blockchain, no node; the card contains only private keys, and an algorithm to sign a transaction
* the smart card should have its own keyboard (for pin code protection) and display (to show the transaction amount)
(<- Alternative to this is the card returning, to the terminal screen, the debit amount multiplied by a number only the card holder knows which cycles from 1 to 100 to 1 incrementing by 1 each transfer - the card is locked 10 minutes if a second amount is send before a pin is typed.)

* The card holder will know pin, puk, private key and address only from when he programmed it or ordered his smart card.
* the card should implement a deterministic wallet, so that funds can be recovered if the card is lost.

###Usage scenario

* the reading device may belong to a merchant at a point of sale; it cannot be trusted with private keys. 
* the reading device is connected to a full bitcoin node; it can be trusted for getting and sending blockchain information.
* the reading device sends to the card the current balance of its bitcoin addresses. This information can be cached in the card.
* the reading device sends a bitcoin receiving address and transaction amount to the card.
* the amount is displayed by the card ; the user confirms the transaction with his pin code.
* the smart card creates a signed transaction and sends it to the reading device
* the transaction is checked and broadcast by the bitcoin node.

##Implementation steps

###1. write a bitcoin daemon that can talk to a lightweight wallet

* this has been done already, see for example bitcoinjs: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib
* See also this pull request: [importexporttx](https://github.com/piotrnar/bitcoin/tree/importexporttx) can be used to broadcast the transaction

###2. write a lightweight wallet

* wallet without blockchain, in order to test the daemon
* this lightweight wallet will be later implemented on the card 
* use it to define the communication protocol between card and reading device.

update: this is done, see [[Electrum]]

###3. implement wallet on a simple smart card

* http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc openSC : tools and libraries for smart cards. 
* amadousarr.free.fr/crypto/ECDSAJAVACARD.pdf : A Software Implementation of ECDSA on a Java Smart Card
* http://www.acs.com.hk : cards, readers, development kits; no display, pincode needs to be typed on the reading device

###4. implement wallet on a smart card with display and pincode
