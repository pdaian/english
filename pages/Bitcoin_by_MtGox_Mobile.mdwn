Bitcoin by MtGox Mobile (formerly branded as MtGox Live Mobile) is a mobile app that brings many of the features from the Mt. Gox exchange's website to the mobile user.  The app can be used to buy and sell bitcoins, view a real-time visual display of the buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders currently open on [[MtGox]] exchange and see real time trades and trade history.

The page <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">requires a browser that</span> supports Websockets (1.1).  Apple Safari (1.2) and Google Chrome (1.3) are two such browsers that support Websockets.  Firefox also supports through about:config.  The website also works with any ajax browser, including android.

MtGox Live has further grown to provide an Android and iOS application and a bitcoin address shortener service, btc.to.
The Bitcoin trading community can chat in the [[!template id=freenode_irc mtgoxlive]] IRC channel on Freenode.
