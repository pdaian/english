During the described process of generating a bitcoin address, can it further be explained which parts are the private key or how they are computed too?

This wiki says a bitcoin address can have a length between 27 and 34 characters. But acc. to "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=278814.msg2978906#msg2978906" bitcoin addresses with only 26 (!) characters are also possible as well. What is written there appears plausible to me, so maybe someone skilled can verify, and if confirmed, correct the text in this wiki. --[Michael_S](User:Michael_S), 14:13, 7 December 2013 (CET)
