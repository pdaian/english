Sending bitcoins to an IP address was a convenient way of sending bitcoins to a Bitcoin address along with additional information.

* You contact the IP address to find out if they're actually running Bitcoin and accepting IP transactions. If not, no transaction occurs.
* Your additional information ("from", "message", etc.) is exchanged with the server.
* The server generates a brand new Bitcoin address and sends it to you.
* You send coins to this [[address]] in the normal way

Unfortunately, the implementation provided no authentication, so any "man in the middle" could have intercepted your bitcoins during the transaction. When they see that you're sending a Bitcoin payment by IP address, they pretend to be the actual destination and send back *their* Bitcoin address. You end up sending bitcoins to the wrong person. It's therefore no longer a good idea to send bitcoins in this way, *especially* if you're using a proxy.

##Status
This feature has been removed from Bitcoin Core as-of v0.8.0 (2.1)
