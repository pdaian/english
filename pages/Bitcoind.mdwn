The **Original Bitcoin client** is the first [[bitcoin]] client in the network's history. It is also the official client of the bitcoin project. It's available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) for Windows, 32 and 64-bit GNU/Linux-based OSes and Mac OS X.

The client comes with two executables, a GUI and an command line interface (CLI).

## Executables

### Bitcoin (GUI)

The bitcoin GUI provides an easy to use wxWidgets-based interface, allowing to receive and send bitcoins, and generate bitcoins using the computer's CPU power.

### Bitcoind (CLI)

The bitcoind CLI interface runs as a daemon, and provides a JSON-RPC interface allowing to control it locally or remotely. [[Various commands|Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list]] are made available by the API.
