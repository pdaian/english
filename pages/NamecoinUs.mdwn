NamecoinUs! is a project intended to bridge [[namecoin]] domains to common users that do not have the .bit available by their default DNS provider. The project also runs an in-line proxy (http://example.bit => http://example.bit.namecoin.us), a namecoin WHOIS server, and an expiry tracker for namecoin domains. It also offers various namecoin-related tools.
