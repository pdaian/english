**MyBitcoin** is one of the earliest [[eWallet]] providers for Bitcoin. See [[MyBitcoin_SCI]] if you're looking for information on how to use MyBitcoin merchant service.

Bitcoins sent from a MyBitcoin account will not necessarily originate from the same [[bitcoin addresses|Address]] that were used to receive the Bitcoins. This property can be utilised to improve [[anonymity|Anonymity]].

Amounts sent to an account on MyBitcoin will be [[confirmed|Confirmation]] after just one block and will then show in the balance and can be spent immediately.

##Features

* Address forwarding - Anything earned in your mybitcoin account can be transfered automatically to a desired address.

##Support

The best (and likely only) method to obtain support is to use the site's [messaging system](https://www.mybitcoin.com/contact-us.php).

##History
For a period of a day or so beginning 02-17-2011, deposits to the mybitcoin.com eWallet service were not being registered to users' accounts. (4.1)

##Criticism

There is no method to reset the password without first logging in.  To use the site's contact form login is first required.

Due to MyBitcoin's practice of crediting an account after the transaction appears in just one [[block]], after receiving payment a prudent step might be to verify confirmation manually using [[Block_Explorer]] before delivering shipment -- especially if there is no recourse should the payment fail to confirm.

This service shows the name MyBitcoin LLC and a mailing address in Nevis.  It is not known if this truly is an LLC and if so, where the organization is located.  There has been no member of the Bitcoin community who has claimed any affiliation with MyBitcoin.

There is no way to verify the claim that all bitcoins from the account balances are available.  The [Terms of Service](http://www.mybitcoin.com/legal/terms.php) do state:
>  <tt>6. OBLIGATIONS OF MYBITCOIN LLC<br>6.1 MYBITCOIN LLC will ensure that for all Bitcoins in circulation in the MyBitcoin System there is at all times an identical quantity of unencumbered Bitcoins held in MYBITCOIN LLC's master Bitcoin wallet.</tt>
