A script that converts USD prices to BTC dynamically, based on a weighted average of the recent Mt.Gox trades. The weighted average is updated every 5 minutes.

The way this works is the script, hosted on the sanescreen.org server, references a separate javascript file which holds the the exchange rate hard-coded as a variable assignment.  The separate javascript file is what gets updated frequently to reflect the current rate.
