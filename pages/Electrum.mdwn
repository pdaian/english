Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin client, based on a client-server protocol. 
It was released on november 5, 2011.

###Main features:

* Encrypted wallet
* Deterministic key generation. If you lose your wallet, you can recover it from its seed.
* No blockchain download; the client requests that information from a server
* Private keys are not shared with the server.
* Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.
* No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server.
* Python. Very compact code, easy to contribute.

###Brain Wallet

Electrum uses a type 2 deterministic key generation algorithm.
This means that all the keys are derived from a seed.

Electrum makes it easy to memorize its seed, because it uses a mnemonic code.

Example:

* hexadecimal: 8a44dfd6ad4f687b5e3c80563c327027 
* mnemonic: "shade weave eternity kept true tangle new talk clay warmth fish match"

###Multiple wallets
Electrum uses one single file per wallet. Your default wallet is located in your user account.
If you want to use another wallet, use the -w option followed by the wallet path and name:
<pre>
$ ./electrum -w /path/to/my/wallet/wallet_name
</pre>

###Export and import addresses

You can export your private keys using the 'addresses' command:
<pre>
$ ./electrum addresses -ak

</pre>
The option -a means: 'list all addresses' 
The option -k means: display the private keys

You can also import addresses into an electrum wallet, with the 'import' command:
<pre>
$ ./electrum import 1LGoehbyeX4QBEPK1a6dhyaoMQZfqg5LKX:5JBSttEGhjEcPidSovW66Rin2EZ6LEHZ2qx8Pu2RqqNaDTBVWaF
keypair imported
</pre>
Note that imported keys do not belong to the deterministic sequence of your wallet; if you import keys in a wallet, you must backup it up!

###Offline wallet

It is possible to create a transaction while your computer is offline, and to broadcast it from another computer, 
with a wallet that does not have the seed or private keys.

####How to prepare an offline wallet

* step 1: create a wallet on your offline computer
<pre>
$ ./electrum -w wallet create
</pre>

* step 2: save the seed of your wallet to a file that will remain on the offline computer:
<pre>
./electrum -w wallet seed | awk '{print $1}'> seedfile
</pre>

* step 3: blank the seed in your wallet file. 
For example, under linux, you may type:
<pre>
$ cat w | sed "s/`cat seedfile`/trololololo/g" > wallet.no_seed
</pre>
or you can open the file in an editor and do it manually. After this step you may remove the wallet file:
<pre>
rm wallet
</pre>

* step 4: transfer the wallet.no_seed file to the online computer.
For example, copy the wallet file to a usb stick:
<pre>
$ cp wallet.no_seed /my/usb/wallet.no_seed
</pre>
and once you have plugged the usb key to the online computer:
<pre>
$ cp /my/usb/wallet.no_seed ./wallet.no_seed
</pre>

* step 5: run electrum on the online computer; this will synchronize your wallet with the bitcoin network, and you will be able to monitor incoming transactions:
<pre>
./electrum -w wallet.no_seed
</pre>

####How to send a transaction with an offline wallet

* step 1: copy the synchronized wallet file to your offline computer
<pre>
$ cp wallet.no_seed /usb/stick/wallet.no_seed
</pre>

* step 2: edit the wallet file and restore the seed :
<pre>
$ cat w | sed "s/trololololo/`cat seedfile`/g" > wallet.seed
</pre>
you may also do this manually with a file editor if you do not know how to use sed.

* step 3: create the transaction
<pre>
./electrum -w wallet.seed mktx <recipient> <amount>  >  tx_file
</pre>

* step 4: with the usb stick, copy the transaction to the online computer:
<pre>
$cp tx_file /usb/tx_file
</pre>
and:
<pre>
$cp /usb/tx_file tx_file
</pre>

* step 5: broadcast the transaction:
<pre>
./electrum sendtx <transaction> `cat tx_file`
</pre>
