[Electrum](http://electrum.org) is a lightweight Bitcoin client, based on a client-server protocol. 
It was released on november 5, 2011.

**Main features:**

* Encrypted wallet: the file that contains your bitcoins is protected with a password. You are protected from thieves.
* Deterministic key generation: If you lose your wallet, you can recover it from its seed. You are protected from your own mistakes.
* Instant on: the client does not download the blockchain, it requests that information from a server. No delays, always up-to-date.
* Transactions are signed locally: Your private keys are not shared with the server. You do not have to trust the server with your money.
* Freedom and Privacy: The server does not store user accounts. You are not tied to a particular server, and the server does not need to know you. You can export your private keys.
* No scripts: Electrum does not download any script. A compromised server cannot send you arbitrary code and steal your bitcoins.
* No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server.
* Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.
* Free software: Gnu GPL v3. Anyone can audit the code.
* Written in Python. The code is short, and easy to review.
* Support for Bitcoin URIs, signed URIs and Bitcoin aliases

###Updates
**Some contents can be outdated or deprecated. To see up to date documentation visit the repository [Electrum Docs](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/docs)**

###Graphical User Interfaces
Electrum has two GUIs: one that is based on Gtk, and a newer one based on Qt. The Qt GUI is enabled by default. To use the gtk interface, type:
<pre>
$ ./electrum -g gtk
</pre>
In addition, Electrum has a rich set of commands for the command line interface.

###Brain Wallet

Electrum uses a type 2 deterministic key generation algorithm.
This means that all the keys are derived from a seed.

Typical seeds have 128 bits of entropy. Electrum provides mnemonic code in order to represent the seed.

Example:

* hexadecimal: 431a62f1c86555d3c45e5c4d9e10c8c7 
* mnemonic: "constant forest adore false green weave stop guy fur freeze giggle clock"

You can display the seed with the command line interface. Example:
<pre>
$ ./electrum getseed
Password:
431a62f1c86555d3c45e5c4d9e10c8c7 "constant forest adore false green weave stop guy fur freeze giggle clock"
</pre>

###Wallet File
The default wallet file is called default_wallet which is created when you first run the application and located under the /wallets folder.

On Windows

* Show hidden files
* Go to \Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Local\Electrum

On Mac

* Open Finder
* Go > Go to folder (shift+cmd+G) and type ~/.electrum

On Linux

* Home Folder
* Go > Location and type ~/.electrum

###Multiple wallets
Electrum uses one single file per wallet. Your default wallet is located in your user account as listed above.
If you want to use another wallet, use the -w option followed by the wallet path and name:
<pre>
$ ./electrum -w /path/to/my/wallet/wallet_name
</pre>

###Export and import addresses

You can export your private keys using the 'dumpprivkeys' command:
<pre>
$ ./electrum dumpprivkeys
Password:
{
"1LGoehbyeX4QBEPK1a6dhyaoMQZfqg5LKX": "5JBSttEGhjEcPidSovW66Rin2EZ6LEHZ2qx8Pu2RqqNaDTBVWaF"   
"1KcsBJa2cCxVkGJfSsg5bUeXN7Y5uLa8mP": "5KiP4uiNT6KG8jnXbainCM8rDWRrgxt3PAyut4FFpDoCo1Rh6VM"   
"1PXsn7LVXTccGhJPTUL8r2EGB4fF9kvex3": "5Kj8mvBJReyk8xEBMx5cTnciQCxto5JmudiTPkqwMcd61Kf1Jqc"   
"1KteSFTAphyByLTtUfFiVQ9s7fMVmx7c2h": "5JeZ3FTbWcksLt3PKydd5U9p952UQRHwv3LoxzCA9LZ7V2bku5p"   
"1GE5ZChAobeTEPLHDCDDKTSg3XvLkcQFjS": "5JwtGEygTwF2nouhRVzW3w5DWZd1sCgxLtnd1v51wjkbUrp5sqH"   
"12YNehfAoYTiwjTXULwaZqTCauu2D61fq6": "5Jvcq19ePCXKcVun4n7US99CsrEByUK2kgxXBA3rBVBqYZjhfwD"  [change] 
}
</pre>

You can also import addresses into an electrum wallet, with the 'importprivkey' command:
<pre>
$ ./electrum importprivkey 5JBSttEGhjEcPidSovW66Rin2EZ6LEHZ2qx8Pu2RqqNaDTBVWaF
Keypair imported:  1LGoehbyeX4QBEPK1a6dhyaoMQZfqg5LKX
</pre>
Note that imported keys do not belong to the deterministic sequence of your wallet; if you import keys in a wallet, you must back it up!

###Offline wallet

It is possible to create a transaction on an offline computer,
and to broadcast them from another computer, with a wallet that does not have the seed or private keys.
