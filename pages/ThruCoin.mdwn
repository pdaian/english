A bitcoin-based escrow service.

Essentially, this service allows the payment recipient to know that the payment sender has delivered payment to an independent third party escrow.  Funds are held by the escrow service until the payment sender releases the funds to the payment recipient.

ThruCoin was announced on November 28, 2011 (1.1).
