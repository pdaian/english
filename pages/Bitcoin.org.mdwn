An informal association of [[participants|People]] who architect, design, build, release and support the Bitcoin.org client software released as [[bitcoind]] and [[Bitcoin-Qt]].  The group also leads and influences development related to the Bitcoin [[protocol_specification]].

Collaboration by the group occurs through the [Bitcoin/Bitcoin project](http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) on GitHub, [Bitcoin development mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=244765), the [#bitcoin-dev](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#bitcoin-dev) IRC channel, on the [[BitcoinTalk]] forum (primarily on the [Development & Technical Discussion](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) board), the [[Bitcoin wiki|index]] and through other other various online [communities](Bitcoin:Community_portal).

The [[development_process]] followed by the group has evolved and now a [[Bitcoin Improvement Process|BIP]] is generally followed.  A [[release_process]] has also been formalized.

##History

The Bitcoin.org domain was registered on August 18, 2008 -- presumably by [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]] before even publishing the Bitcoin design paper (2.1).

On May 7, 2012 the project's lead developer, [[Gavin_Andresen]], announced plans for forming the Bitcoin Testing Project (2.2).
