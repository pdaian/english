[gribble](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/) is a modified Supybot IRC bot, carrying some useful bitcoin-related commands and factoids. The bot's command sequence is ';;', to issue any command just start a line with two semicolons. You can also issue inline commands with two commas. 

It is present on #bitcoin (general discussion), #bitcoin-dev (bitcoin information queries), #bitcoin-otc (facilitate over-the-counter trading, with the OTC order book and OTC web of trust), and a number of other channels. You can also PM commands to gribble and it will PM back.

##Source code

The core of gribble is a modified supybot. Code lives [here](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/).

The code for bitcoin-related plugins lives [here](https://github.com/nanotube/supybot-bitcoin-marketmonitor/).

##General Info

To get help on any command, try 'help <command>', to get a list of bitcoin-related aliases, run 'apropos bc', and to get a list of factoids, run command 'facts', and click on the link supplied.

##List of commands

###Mining/network/hashrate stats

* **hextarget** - show the current [[difficulty]] target in hex. if optional [[block]] number argument is specified, show target for that block.
* **bcstats** - show some statistics about the block chain - number of blocks, difficulty, estimated next difficulty target, time to next difficulty
* **blocks** - show the current number of blocks in the bitcoin block chain
* **blockdiff** - show difficulty for a specified past block.
* **bounty** - show current block reward bounty, in BTC.
* **diff** - show the current generation difficulty
* **diffchange** - show estimated percent change in difficulty
* **estimate** - show the estimate of the next difficulty, based on data since last change (5.1), and for last three days.
* **genprob** - show the probability of getting at least one block at given hashrate, in a given time period, at given difficulty. uses current difficulty by default.
* **genrate** - given the hash rate, and optional difficulty, calculate expected BTC generation per day and per hour. uses current difficulty by default.
* **gentime** - given a hash rate, and optional difficulty level, calculate the expected average time to generate a block. uses current difficulty by default.
* **halfreward** - show estimated time of next block reward halving.
* **interval** - show the average time between blocks, over the past 1000 blocks. If given optional integer argument, use that many blocks for the estimate.
* **nethash** - current 3-day estimate of network hash power, in Ghps.
* **nextretarget** - show the block at which the next difficulty change will take place
* **prevdiff** - show previous difficulty level
* **prevdiffchange** - show previous difficulty percent change.
* **timetonext** - show estimated time to reach the next difficulty target
* **totalbc** - show total number of bitcoins in existence.
* **tblb** -- given an interval in seconds, calculate the expected time between blocks which take at least <interval> seconds to create.
* **tslb** - show time elapsed since last generated block.

Big kudos goes out to theymos for providing a web interface to [real time statistics about the bitcoin block chain](http://blockexplorer.com/q/), and to http://blockchain.info for a similar service.

###Markets and exchange rates

* **avgprc** - show average 24h, 7d, and 30d trading prices of BTC in various currencies.
* **bc,convert** - convert bitcoin price, based on Mt.Gox last, to currency you specify. e.g., try 'bc,convert eur' for euros.
* **bc,fx** - show various currency exchange rates
* **bc,xag** - show price of silver in BTC
* **bc,xau** - show price of gold in BTC
* **ticker** - show pretty-printed ticker. takes a number of optional arguments to customize output.
* **bids** - given a numeric argument, shows how many total btc are being demanded on MtGox at or over the given price. If optional '--under' argument given, looks under the price.
* **asks** - given a numeric argument, shows how many total btc are being offered on MtGox at or below given price. If optional '--over' argument given, looks over the price.
* **market buy** - supply number of btc to buy (or with --usd option, number of dollars to spend buying), to see the results of such a market order.
* **market sell** - supply number of btc to sell (or with --usd option, number of dollars receive from selling), to see the results of such a market order.
* **obip** - order book implied price. finds the weighted average price of BTC by averaging over the order book N coins away from the spread in both directions.
* **baratio** - shows total USD volume of bids, total BTC volume of asks, and ratio of the two.

###Mining pool statistics

Current hash rates are shown in Mhps.

* **bc,slushpool**
* **bc,eligius**
* **bc,p2pool**
* **bc,btcguild**
* **bc,deepbit**
* **bc,ozcoin**
* **bc,bitpenny**

###Other

* **bc,help** - show list of 'bc,' commands - same as 'apropos bc'.
* **bc,wiki** - fetch a link to a page in this wiki, based on a search string. For example, to see a link to this page, try 'bc,wiki gribble'.

###General commands

The above list is specifically for bitcoin-related commands. See [this page](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gribble/index.php?title=Using_Gribble_on_Sourceforge) for list and help of most commonly used non-bitcoin-related gribble commands. You can find more helpful info on the [gribble](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/) project page, or by exploring the bot with 'list' and 'help' commands.
