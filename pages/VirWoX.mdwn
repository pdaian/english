##Instructions

###How to buy bitcoins

####With Linden Dollars
After you have opened (4.1) an account,
deposit the Linden Dollars (SLL) at one of the in-world terminals (4.2) in Second Life.

Then log in on the VirWoX website and enter an order to buy BTC on the "Exchange BTC/SLL" page. Depending on the type of order (Market or Limit),
this will convert the Linden Dollars to BTC immediately or at some later time (4.3).
Finally use the "Withdraw" page to send the BTC to a Bitcoin address. You can also use VirWoX as a [[eWallet]] and keep your BTC there for later use.

####With other currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
Technically, VirWoX only supports to buy BTC for Linden Dollars. However, you can first buy Linden Dollars for real-world currency, and then buy BTC for your Linden Dollars. It is not necessary to open a Second Life account to do this.

The following payment methods are available:

###How to sell bitcoins

After your have opened an account, go to the "Deposit" page, scroll down to the "Bitcoin" section and click on the "Create my Bitcoin address" button.
This will create a unique bitcoin address associated with your account. You then send the bitcoins you wish to sell to this address.
As soon as the bitcoin network has [[confirmed|confirmation]] the payment (5 blocks), the bitcoins are booked to your account, and an email is sent to you.

####For Linden Dollars

To exchange bitcoins to Linden Dollars, go to the page "Exchange BTC/SLL", and enter an order to sell your bitcoins.
Depending on your order (Market or Limit), this will be executed instantly or at some later time.
You may then withdraw the Linden Dollars to your Second Life avatar or continue as described below.

####For other currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)

Technically, VirWoX only supports to sell BTC for Linden Dollars. However, you can first do that (as described above)
and then buy some real-world cash for your Linden Dollars.  It is not necessary to open a Second Life account to do this.
Just go to the corresponding exchange page
(e.g. USD/SLL for USD, EUR/SLL for EUR), and buy the real-world currency for the Linden Dollars. Then proceed to the "withdraw" page
and send the money using one of the supported withdrawal methods:



|[[!template id=rh]]Bank Wire|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|2-3 days|unlimited|1 EUR (if from EU in EUR)
|[[!template id=rh]][[PayPal]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|instant|2500 EUR/day|1 EUR/USD/GBP/CHF
|[[!template id=rh]][[Moneybookers]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=no]]|instant|2500 EUR/day|1 EUR/USD/GBP/CHF
|[[!template id=rh]]NETELLER|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=no]]|instant|2500 EUR/day|1 EUR/USD/GBP/CHF


##Fees
VirWoX charges 50 SLL (currently about 0.02 BTC) plus 1% for BTC/SLL market orders. The fee for limit orders depends on the previous trading volume of the account, and varies between 0.78% and 3.9% (9.1).

VirWoX charges 0.02 BTC for BTC withdrawals. Deposits in BTC are free.

##Limits and Restrictions

Because of the risks involved, VirWoX restricts deposits via PayPal and Moneybookers (i.e. Credit/Debit Cards) depending on the age of the account. Initially you can deposit only 60 EUR (or 84 USD) per day. This limit grows to 500 EUR or 700 USD per day after 30 days (10.1). Higher limits are available on request.

Another quite serious restriction is that trades are limited to whole units. E.g. you can only trade whole EUR to Linden Dollars (SLL). Even bigger is the problem that you can only buy whole bitcoins. Since one bitcoin is now worth a 4-digit amount of SLL this is a really big restriction - you'll quite probably end up with a bigger rest of SLL and have to spend additional money to use this rest.
