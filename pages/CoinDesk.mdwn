[[!template id=infobox_company name=CoinDesk image=[[File:Coindesk.png]] industry=News founder="[[Shakil Khan]]" foundation="May 1, 2013" website=http://www.coindesk.com/]]A global news resource on Bitcoin and digital currencies.
This London-based resource and news operation aims to be the “Reuters of Bitcoin” according to its founder [[Shakil_Khan]]. As an angel investor in Spotify and bitcoin startup [[BitPay]], Khan noticed a gap in the news coverage for bitcoin and digital currencies in general when other entrepreneurs constantly questioned him about bitcoin. CoinDesk was launched on May 1st 2013. (1.1) In September 2013, [[Jon_Matonis]], executive director of the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]] joined CoinDesk as a contributing editor.
##CoinDesk Information Centre
On August 21st 2013, (2.1) CoinDesk launched a [bitcoin information centre](http://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-launches-bitcoin-information-centre/). This contained guides on everything from the very basics of digital currency to how to set up your own bitcoin mining rig.
##CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index
CoinDesk launched a proprietary Bitcoin Price Index on September 11, 2013. (3.1) The Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges that meet criteria specified by the BPI. It is intended to serve as a standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals.
Criteria for inclusion in the BPI are:

1. Exchange must serve an international customer base;
1. Exchange must provide a bid-offer spread for an immediate sale (offer) and an immediate purchase (bid);
1. Minimum trade size must be less than 1,500 USD or equivalent;
1. Daily trading volume must meet minimum acceptable levels as determined by CoinDesk;
1. Banking transfers in or out of the exchange must be completed within seven business days.
Upon launch, [[BitStamp]], [[BTC-e]] and [[CampBX]] met these criteria and were included in the index. On the 7th Nov 2013 [[CampBX]] was removed from the BPI due to sustained diminishing volume and a lack of regular 24-hour trading activity. On the 28th Nov 2013 [[Mt._Gox]] was added to the BPI due to a reduction in the risk premium and the option of additional deposit/withdrawal methods.
Mt. Gox was removed from the Price Index on Feb 10th, (3.2) after on-going withdrawal issues with the Mt.Gox exchange. (3.3) 
Bitfinex was added to the USD BPI in March, 2014. (3.4)
On the 26th March 2014, a new standalone index for the Chinese Yuan was created. (3.5) Upon launch, data from [[BTCChina]] and [[OKCoin]] were included. On the 30th Jun 2014 [[LakeBTC]] and [[Huobi]] data was added to the USD and CNY BPIs respectively.
The main features of the index are as follows:

* The CoinDesk BPI is a simple average of leading XBT/USD exchange prices;
* The BPI is expressed as the midpoint of bid/ask spread;
* The BPI is updated every 60 seconds;
* If an exchange does not update its price for more than 30 minutes, it is omitted from the live BPI calculation until it is updated again;
* New index historical data commences on 1 July 2013;
* Prior index historical data is obtained via [[Mt._Gox]];
* End-of-day high, low, and closing BPI is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or British Summer Time (BST) when appropriate;
* Non-USD BPI prices are implied based on rates obtained via openexchangerates.org;
The CoinDesk BPI is now used by the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]] and several charting platforms. A free [API is available for developers](http://www.coindesk.com/api/). Several noteworthy publications have referenced the BPI data or price, such as the BBC, (3.6) (3.7) WSJ, (3.8) Reuters, (3.9) The Guardian, (3.10) NY Times, (3.11) CNBC, (3.12) TIME, (3.13) Bloomberg, (3.14) MarketWatch, (3.15) TechCrunch, (3.16) Business Insider (3.17) and Forbes. (3.18)

## Consensus 2015
CoinDesk's first conference is [Consensus 2015](http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/). The event is planned to take place in New York on September 10th (4.1). 

##State of Bitcoin Reports
In February, CoinDesk released it's first 'State of Bitcoin' report. (5.1) The aim of the report is "to provide an overview of key cryptocurrency trends, challenges, and opportunities, while also highlighting the most important developments over the last year.”
CoinDesk released an update of the report for Q2 2014. This highlighted that Venture Capital investment in bitcoin companies was up 28 percent compared to the previous quarter, (5.2) and that VC investment was pouring into European Bitcoin startups. (5.3) The Q3 Report showed how the ecosystem was progressing, despite erosion of the bitcoin price. A slide based on key adoption metrics was highlighted by well known VC Fred Wilson. (5.4)

## CoinDesk iPhone App 
In April 2014, CoinDesk released an iOS app. (6.1) The app includes news stories and editorial, as well as its 'Bitcoin Price Index'.
## Bitcoin Sentiment Index 
In August 2014 CoinDesk released a new bitcoin tracking tool: the Bitcoin Sentiment Index. (7.1) The tool uses data from Qruisly to gauge how people are feeling about bitcoin’s prospects in the U.S. and the U.K. The sentiment index was discontinued in May 2015.
