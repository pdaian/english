Shouldn't this be moved to something like [[Browser-based_wallet]] instead?  EWallet is presumably short for "electronic wallet", which doesn't really mean the same thing as a wallet on a third-party website.  I mean, your wallet.dat file is just as "electronic" as MyBitcoin.

Before moving an established page like this one you might wish to get some feedback first.  - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 23:58, 18 April 2011 (GMT)

Whichever name this article ends up as, there's a [fair amount of updates](Special:WhatLinksHere/EWallet) <strike>required</strike> recommended then too.
