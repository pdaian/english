**secp256k1** refers to the parameters of the [[ECDSA]] curve used in Bitcoin, and is defined in *Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SEC)* (Certicom Research, http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf).

secp256k1 was almost never used before Bitcoin became popular, but it is now gaining in popularity due to its several nice properties. Most commonly-used curves have a random structure, but secp256k1 was constructed in a special non-random way which allows for especially efficient computation. As a result, it is often more than 30% faster than other curves if the implementation is sufficiently optimized. Also, unlike the popular NIST curves, secp256k1's constants were selected in a predictable way, which significantly reduces the possibility that the curve's creator inserted any sort of backdoor into the curve.

### Technical details

As excerpted from *Standards*: 

The elliptic curve domain parameters over F*<sub>p</sub>* associated with a Koblitz curve secp256k1 are specified
by the sextuple T = (*p,a,b,G,n,h*) where the finite field F*<sub>p</sub>* is defined by:

* *p* = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F
* = 2<sup>256</sup> - 2<sup>32</sup> - 2<sup>9</sup> - 2<sup>8</sup> - 2<sup>7</sup> - 2<sup>6</sup> - 2<sup>4</sup> - 1

The curve *E*: *y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup>+ax+b* over F*<sub>p</sub>* is defined by:

* *a* = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
* *b* = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000007

The base point G in compressed form is:

* *G* = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798
and in uncompressed form is:

* *G* = 04 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8
Finally the order *n* of *G* and the cofactor are:

* *n* = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141
* *h* = 01
